    Re-add audio device combo box to synth select dialog (#15486)
    
    Link to issue number:
    Partially reverts #15472.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The "output device" option has been removed from the NVDA+Control+s dialog. This breaks muscle memory for long-time NVDA users and makes it very hard to blindly (without audible speech or connected Braille) change sound devices in the event of unexpected device switching.
    
    Description of how this pull request fixes the issue:
    Selectively reverts the change in #15472 that removes the option from the synth selection dialog.
    
    Testing strategy:
    Verified that the "output device" option in both dialogs works as expected
