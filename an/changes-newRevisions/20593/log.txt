    Fix Excel error due to state enum changes (PR #13465)
    
    Summary:
    With UIA for Excel disabled, navigating to a cell with a formula and "has formula" was not reported.
    This is a regression caused by #13414
    
    In `NVDAHelper/remote/excel.cpp` the properties of a cell were determined and bits were set on the `state` member of a `EXCEL_CELLINFO` struct.
    The constants used for this are in `NVDAHelper/remote/excel/Constants.h`, see the `NVSTATE_*` constants, previously these matched the `controlTypes.State` constants directly.
    
    Description of change:
    Rather than couple the excel implementation to the controlTypes implementation, these constants have been converted to enums (both in C++ and in Python), renumbered, and an explicit mapping to the corresponding `controlTypes.State` enum has been created.
    
    Fixes #13457
