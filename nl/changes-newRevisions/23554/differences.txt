 ## 2024.3
-The Add-on Store will now notify you if any add-on updates are available on NVDA start up.
 
-This release adds support for Unicode Normalization to speech and braille output.
+The Add-on Store will now notify you if any add-on updates are available on NVDA startup.
+
+There are now options to apply Unicode normalization to speech and braille output.
 This can be useful when reading characters that are unknown to a particular speech synthesizer or braille table and which have a compatible alternative, like the bold and italic characters commonly used on social media.
 It also allows reading of equations in the Microsoft Word equation editor.
 
+Help Tech Activator Pro braille displays are now supported.
+
+Unassigned commands have been added to scroll the mouse wheel vertically and horizontally.
+
 There are several bug fixes, particularly for the Windows 11 Emoji Panel and Clipboard history.
 For web browsers, there are fixes for reporting error messages, figures, captions, table labels and checkbox/radio button menu items.
 
-Liblouis has been updated, adding new Braille tables for Cyrillic Serbian, Yiddish, several ancient languages (Biblical Hebrew, Akkadian, Syriac, and Ugaritic), and transliterated Cuneiform text.
