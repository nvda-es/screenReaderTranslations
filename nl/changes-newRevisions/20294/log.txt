    Ensure that role label for landmark is once again abbreviated in braille (PR #13160)
    
    Fixes #13158
    
    PR #12814 replaced usages of deprecated controlTypes.roleLabels with role.displayString. However braille has its own mapping of roles to labels which should be used for abbreviations of roles for braille. The role label used for speech has been mistakenly used for a role of landmark.
