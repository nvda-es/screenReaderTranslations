    Revert diff_match_patch upgrade (#16168)
    
    Fixes #16027
    Reverts #15514
    This reverts commit 69a16cc.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    PR #15514 upgraded diff_match_patch from 1.0.2 to fast_diff_match_patch 2.0.1.
    However, the newer version cannot handle particular unicode characters such as üç∞. The diff_match_patch process dies, NvDA can no longer report text changes, and NvDA hangs on exit.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Printing unicode characters such as üç∞ in a terminal withn using diff_match_patch for speaking changes no longer causes NvDA to no longer report text changes and lock up on exit.
    
    Description of development approach
    Downgrade back to diff_match_patch 1.0.2.
