    Prefer custom braille drivers to HID braille. (PR #13150)
    
    Try to use new HID protocol after, not before all other driver matches
    
    Closes #13153
    Summary:
    Auto detection was broken for Humanware Brailliant and APH Mantis q40 when working over Bluetooth. It looks like they implement an incomplete version of the HID protocol.
