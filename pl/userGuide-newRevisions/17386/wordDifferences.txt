Add-ons are considered incompatible when they have not been updated to work with significant changes to NVDA, or when they rely on a feature not available in the version of NVDA you are using.
The Incompatible add-ons manager has a short message to explain its purpose as well as the version of NVDA.

++ Run COM registration fixing tool... ++[RunCOMRegistrationFixingTool]
Installing and uninstalling programs on a computer can, in certain cases, cause COM DLL files to get unregistered.
As COM Interfaces such as IAccessible depend on correct COM DLL registrations, issues can appear in case the correct registration is missing.

This can happen i.e. after installing and uninstalling Adobe Reader, Math Player and other programs.

The missing registration can cause issues in browsers, desktop apps, task bar and other interfaces.

Specifically, following issues can be solved by running this tool:
- NVDA reports "unknown" when navigating in browsers such as Firefox, Thunderbird etc.
- NVDA fails to switch between focus mode and browse mode
- NVDA is very slow when navigating in browsers while using browse mode
- And possibly other issues.
