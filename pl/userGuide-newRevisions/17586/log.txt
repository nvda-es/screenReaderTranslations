    Configure sub/super script formatting independently of font attributes (PR #10919)
    
    Reporting of superscript and subscript was based on the "report font attributes" setting.
    A new setting, "report superscripts and subscripts", allows configuring superscript/subscript formatting is announced.
    
    Initial value for setting will match current "report font attributes" on config upgrade.
