    Follow up to #15945
    
    Summary of the issue:

    This is a stored XSS risk
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Should be none - however see known issues
    
    Description of development approach

    Testing strategy:
    Tested building docs, diffed HTML results between this PR and beta.

    This means certain parts of translated documentation will be stripped, i.e. <major>.<minor>.<patch> becomes ..
