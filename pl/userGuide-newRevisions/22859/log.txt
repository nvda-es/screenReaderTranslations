    re-arrange option tables (#16083)
    
    Fixes #16063
    
    Summary of the issue:
    #15950 converted definition lists to tables, however the conversion could have been done better.
    Both lines of the table start with header syntax || whereas it should only be the first header.
    
    Tables were previously converted from definition lists to look like this
    
    Default Enabled
    Options Default (Enabled), Enabled, Disabled
    Options should be listed before default logically.
    The first column should be headers, not the first row.
    Unfortunately there is no good support for column headers in markdown in our markdown parsing stack.
    As such, this can be improved by just having no headers.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Change all option definition tables to be formatted as follows.
    The header row is hidden in CSS
    
    Options Default (Enabled), Enabled, Disabled
    Default Enabled
    Description of development approach
    The following regex was used:
    
    find: \|\|(.*)\|(.*)\|\n\|\|(.*)\|(.*)\|
    replace: || . {.hideHeaderRow} | . |\n|$3|$4|\n|$1|$2|
    Testing strategy:
