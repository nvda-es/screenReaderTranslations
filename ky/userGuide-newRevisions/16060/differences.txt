 You will need the Freedom Scientific braille display drivers installed on your system.
 If you do not have them already, you can obtain them from http://www2.freedomscientific.com/downloads/focus-40-blue/focus-40-14-blue-downloads.asp.
 Although this page only mentions the Focus Blue display, the drivers support all Freedom Scientific Focus and Pacmate displays.
-If your system is running 64 bit Windows and the drivers were already installed by another screen reader, you will probably still need to install the drivers from this link, as the files required by NVDA were probably not installed by the other screen reader.
 
 By default, NVDA can automatically detect and connect to these displays either via USB or bluetooth.
 However, when configuring the display, you can explicitly select "USB" or "Bluetooth" ports to restrict the connection type to be used.
 This might be useful if you want to connect the focus display to NVDA using bluetooth, but still be able to charge it using USB power from your computer.

-These displays do not yet support NVDA's automatic background braille display detection functionality.
+NVDA's automatic braille display detection will also recognize the display on USB or Bluetooth.
 
 Following are the key assignments for this display with NVDA.
 Please see the display's documentation for descriptions of where these keys can be found.
