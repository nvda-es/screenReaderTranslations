as the mercenaries crack the mysterious shard out of the freakish bot, all three recognize that the artifact is in fact exactly what they were all looking for. they decide to team up to bring the shard back to stormwind – but a very particular half-orc sent by kazakus himself intervenes.
the final fight features garona halforcen, famous half-orc assassin of the horde and “king slayer” of llane wrynn, varian’s father, and anduin’s grandfather. wielding the infamous kingsbane, the fact that her deck revolves around weapon enhancement seems self-explanatory.
just like against the pesky bot, getting ahead early turns out to be essential. taunt minions like priest of an’she and lightshower elemental make a great case for themselves for obvious reasons involving garona’s little dagger – not least because or deck severely lacks weapon removal against an “undying” weapon. as it turns out, good old defender of argus also serves as yet another key piece on our way to victory.
similar to the usual aggro rogue/control priest matchup, the fight against garona turns into a wild race of face damage against early defenses. managing your alternating hero power together with aggressive trades can save your life over the course of the game. the one gameplay interaction to look out for is betrayal against scabbs – also known as clearing your whole board as soon as the gnome sits between two big taunts.
build up your taunt army as early as possible, don’t be greedy with removal spells against early-game threats, and the final encounter of xyrella’s book of heroes campaign is yours to win!
