    brailleHID driver: Also allow panning with rocker up and rocker down. (#12993)
    
    NVDA 2021.3 introduces support for the Braille HID standard. However this is very new and not many displays support this yet. The displays that do support this vary in the buttons they provide.
    It is important that we map panning gestures to enough buttons to ensure that any display that supports braille HID should be able to be panned.
    For instance, one display exposes pan left and pan right buttons from the braille HID specification -- we already map these to NVDA's braille scroll back and forward respectively.
    However, the Orbit Reader 20 and 40 do not expose pan left and right keys, but they do have rocker up and rocker down keys.
    Description of how this pull request fixes the issue:
    Also map NVDA's braille scroll forward and scroll back to braille HID's rocker down and rocker up keys respectively.
