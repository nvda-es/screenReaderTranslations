This option allows you to choose whether the braille display will follow the system focus / -{carret,}- +{caret,}+ the navigator object / review cursor, or both.
When "automatically" is selected, NVDA will follow the system focus and caret by default.
In this case, when the navigator object or the review cursor position is changed by means of explicit user interaction, NVDA will tether to review temporarily, until the focus or the caret changes.
