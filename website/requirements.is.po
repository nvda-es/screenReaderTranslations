"- Host it (ideally on GitHub, the [add-on template][1] makes this easy, and "
"create a pull request against [addonFiles][2].  - Edit the get.php file. You "
"need to make sure to have a unique key (add-on ID) in get.php for your "

"released will the API be considered frozen, therefore 'lastTested' should "
"not be set to that version until after the beta."
