"TextNav allows you to find text that you want to read on a web page in just "
"a single keystroke.  More precisely, it adds a keystroke to jump to next or "
"previous text paragraphs - that is a paragraph containing one or more "
"sentences.  This feature might be useful to quickly find the textual part of "
"a web page or to skip over menus, advertisements and other not important "
"page elements."
