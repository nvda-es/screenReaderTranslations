"MathCAT is designed to eventually replace MathPlayer because MathPlayer is "

"speech for math produced by MathCAT is enhanced with prosody so that it "
"sounds more natural. The speech can be navigated in three modes using the "
"same commands as MathPlayer. In addition, the navigation node is indicated "
"on a braille display. Both Nemeth and UEB technical are supported."
