"Tip: If you have not configured NVDA to speak typed characters or words but "
"want to hear typed text in passwords, you may create a configuration profile "
"to enable the speaking of typed characters and passwords, and assign it to a "
"gesture or create a trigger to enable it automatically in certain "
"situations. For convenience, NVDA will ask if you want to create a dedicated "
"profile when the add-on is installed."
