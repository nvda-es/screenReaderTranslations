This NVDA add-on enhances speech and braille output for mathematical content. Although the NVDA already integrating MathPlayer, certain aspects require improvement, such as the lack or incompleteness of language-specific translation, language-specific interactive navigation.

Interactive navigation dissects mathematical content into smaller portions for speech or braille output, allowing for the selection of the desired fragment and mode of delivery through keyboard commands. This enhances one's understanding of the structure and elements of lengthy mathematical content, and the hierarchical relationships between items.

Additionally, this NVDA add-on enables the writing of mathematical content. Using the command menu, input can be executed without having to memorize LaTeX codes. Upon completion, the document can be transformed into a visually comprehensible HTML document via the view and export function, thereby enabling seamless collaboration and discourse with others.

## Reading feature

Access8Math is able to read MathML content in web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge, as well as MathType content in Microsoft Word.

By pressing the space bar or enter key on a MathML math object, you can enter navigation mode and interact with the content by moving, and zooming in or out on reading snippets.

* Analyze the overall mathematical meaning of the content: analyze the structure of MathML, and when it meets a specific rule, read it aloud in the mathematical meaning of the rule
* Analyze the mathematical meaning of the content item: When navigating and browsing, it will prompt the meaning of the content under its upper content. For example, there are two score items, and moving between them will enroll the item as the denominator or numerator

### navigation interactive mode command：

The following commands are available in navigation interactive mode:

* "Down Arrow": Zoom in on a smaller subpart of the math content.
* "Up Arrow": Zoom out to  a larger subpartthe of the math content .
* "Left Arrow": Move to the previous math content.
* "Right Arrow": Move to the next math content.
*	"home": Moves back to the top of the entire math content.
*	"ctrl+C": Copies the MathML source code of the object.
*	"numpad 1~9": Reads the math content as serialized text using NVDA Reviewing Text.
*	"ESC": Exits the navigation mode.

## Writing feature

Comprehensive content: Incorporating Both Text and Mathematical Content

For Windows 11, the Access8Math editor must be used, while for Windows 10 or earlier versions, either Access8Math editor or Notepad can be used. It is recommended to use the built-in Access8Math editor for writing comprehensive content.

To differentiate between text content and mathematical content, LaTeX/AsciiMath separate markers should be used to frame the mathematical area. In other words, the data within the math marker area represents the mathematical content writen by LaTeX/AsciiMath and the text content outside of the math marker area represents regular text.

| category | start delimiter | end delimiter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LaTeX(bracket) | \( | \) |
| LaTeX(money) | $ | $ |
| AsciiMath | ` | ` |

You can choose to use brackets or money  for LaTeX delimiter in the writing setting.

### Command gesture (toggle: NVDA+alt+c)

alt+m: The mark command window pops up, select LaTeX/AsciiMath and press enter to add LaTeX/AsciiMath marks before and after the currently selected text (the current cursor when no text is selected) and automatically move the cursor into it. Enter content quickly.

alt+l: Pop up the LaTeX command window, select the LaTeX command item to be added and press the enter key to add the corresponding LaTeX syntax at the current cursor and automatically move the cursor to the appropriate input point for quick input.

LaTeX command window

* Move to any LaTeX command item and press English letters (a~z) or f1~f12 to set shortcuts
* Move any LaTeX command item and press delete/back space to remove the shortcut that has been set
* Move to any LaTeX command item and press enter to add the corresponding LaTeX syntax at the current cursor

alt+i: When the cursor stops on the math block, you can interact with the math block for navigation

alt+h: HTML documents that can convert text data and mathematical data can be viewed or exported. The content of the math block is converted into MathML and presented side by side with the text to facilitate visual reading.

* View: Open the converted HTML document through the default .HTML extension application set by the system.
* Export: Pack the converted HTML file and the original text file into a compressed file.

alt+t: The data of the block where the cursor is located can be converted between LaTeX and AsciiMath (the cursor needs to be in the LaTeX or AsciiMath block)

In the writing settings, you can choose whether to enable command gestures at startup. Press NVDA+alt+c in the editing area to enable or disable command gestures, which can be changed in input gestures.

### Writing block navigation gestures (toggle: NVDA+alt+n)

* alt+Left arrow key: move to the start point of the previous data block
* alt+Down arrow key: Only read the content of the current data block without moving
* alt+right arrow: move to the start point of the next data block
* alt+home: move to the starting point of the current data block
* alt+end: move to the end point of the current data block
* alt+shift+left arrow: move to the previous data block and select
* alt+shift+down key: do not move, only select the content of the current data block
* alt+shift+right arrow: move to the next data block and select

In the writing settings, you can choose whether to enable the block navigation gestures when starting. Press NVDA+alt+n in the editing area to enable or disable the block navigation gestures, which can be changed in the input gestures.

### Shortcut gestures (toggle: NVDA+alt+s)

When the cursor is in the LaTeX block, press the letter, f1~f12 to quickly insert the bound LaTeX. Press shift+letter, shift+f1~f12 to read out the LaTeX currently bound to the shortcut. (Need to set the shortcut key in the command menu first)

In the writing settings, you can choose whether to enable the quick navigation gestures at startup. Press NVDA+alt+s in the editing area to enable or disable the quick navigation gestures, which can be changed in the input gestures.

### Greek letter gestures (toggle: NVDA+alt+g)

When the cursor is in the LaTeX block, press the letter to quickly insert the corresponding Greek letter LaTeX.

Mapping table

| English letter | Greek letter | LaTeX |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a | α | \alpha |
| b | β | \beta |
| c | θ | \theta |
| d | δ | \delta |
| e | ε | \epsilon |
| f | φ | \phi |
| g | γ | \gamma |
| h | η | \eta |
| i | ι | \iota |
| k | κ | \kappa |

| u | υ | \upsilon |
| v | φ | \psi |
| w | ω | \omega |
| x | χ | \chi |
| y | ξ | \xi |
| z | ζ | \zeta |


### Browse navigation mode (toggle: NVDA+space)

When the navigation mode is turned on, the mathematical data block read by the cursor mobile report will read the mathematical text content instead of the original grammatical data

You can use the following key gestures to move the editing cursor and interactive navigation

* Left key: move to the starting point of the previous data block and read it out
* Right arrow: move to the start point of the next data block and read it out
* Up key: move to the previous line and read out the contents of all data blocks in this line
* Down key: move to the next line and read out the contents of all data blocks in this line
* pageUp: move up ten lines and read out the content of all data blocks in that line
* pageDown: move down ten lines and read out the content of all data blocks in that line
* home: move to the first block of the line where the cursor is located
* end: move to the last block of the line where the cursor is located

Use the cursor to move the key plus the shift key to select the text together

space/enter: When the cursor stops on a math block, it can interact with the math content of the data block to navigate

For the following keys, if you only press the single key, the editing cursor will jump to the next data block position, if you press shift + the single key at the same time, the editing cursor will jump to the previous data block position:

* l: Move to the next LaTeX data block and read it out
* a: Move to the next AsciiMath data block and read it out
* m: move to the next MathML data block and read
* t: move to the next text block and read it
* tab: move to the next interactive block (math block) and read it out

The following key gestures can be used to edit contents

* ctrl+x: cut the current cursor block
* ctrl+c: copy the current cursor block
* ctrl+v: Paste content after the current cursor block
* delete/back space: delete the current cursor block

### Access8Math editor and Access8Math Document

The edit area of Notepad in Windows 11 is rich editing area not traditional editing area, so Access8Math editor must be used in Windows 11 to use the writing feature. This editor provides such as opening old files, saving files, and view feature.

Use the Access8Math editor to write markdown documents, and when document have some resource, the resources can put into workspace of editor and be referenced. When using export feature of the editor, the referenced resources in the document will be packaged into a Archive file by Access8Math editor.

The preview and export feature under the view menu are the same as the command gesture view feature (alt+h), which can generate an Access8Math Document. The only difference between the two is that the Access8Math editor will package referenced resources into a archive file

In order to allow the document exported by the Access8Math editor to be imported again and edited, the Access8Math editor will write a Access8Math.json when exporting, which is the meta data. We call the archive file/folder containing this meta is Access8Math Document

In File Explorer, you can press the NVDA+application, if the selected path is txt/Access8Math Document, a virtual context menu will open, which can quickly open this file to view or edit it.

### content example:

* LaTeX(by bracket separator): The solution of the quadratic equation in one variable \(ax^2+bx+c=0\) is \(\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\) .
* LaTeX(by dollar separator): The solution of the quadratic equation in one variable $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is $\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ .
* AsciiMath: The solution of the quadratic equation in one variable `ax^2+bx+c=0` is `x=(-b+- \sqrt(b^2-4ac))/(2a)` .
* MathML: The solution of the quadratic equation in one variable <math display="inline"><mi>a</mi><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></math> is <math display="inline"><mfrac><mrow><mo>−</mo><mi>b</mi><mi>±</mi><msqrt><msup><mi>b</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>−</mo><mn>4</mn><mi>a</mi><mi>c</mi></msqrt></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>a</mi></mrow></mfrac></math> .

## localization

If you want Access8Math to have speech/braille output for MathML in different languages, you need to create a Unicode dictionary (unicode.dic) and mathematical rules (math.rule). This can be done using the GUI in Access8Math -> Localization, or by referring to the globalPlugins/Access8Math/locale in the plugin folder.

The "Unicode Dictionary" enables you to customize speech or braille output for symbols and characters. The "Mathematics Rules" allow you to customize speech or braille output for different types of mathematics.

"New language" dialog can adding language not included in Access8Math built-in. Upon Adding language option will appear in the Reading Settings language selection, Allowing for the Definition of speech/braille  via the Unicode Dictionary and Mathematics Rules, Resulting in Localization.

### Math Rules

Access8Math establishes 46 mathematical rules according to the mathematical type and logic to decide the reading math method and order. According to different local math reading logic, the math reading text and order can be changed. The method is as follows:

Edit: After entering the "math rule", the window lists 46 math rules. Choose any math rule and select the "Edit" to enter the editing entry.

The "editing entry" can be divided into two major blocks, the "Serialized ordering" and the "Child role".

* Serialized ordering: Math rule is divided into multiple blocks according to the reading order. In this area, the reading order of child node and the delimitation text of start, inter- and the end can be changed. Taking the fractional rule mfrac as an example, this rule is divided into five reading blocks. The order 0, 2, and 4 represent the initial prompt, the project segmentation prompt, and the end prompt, respectively, and the meanings text can be changed in each field. Order 1 and 3 adjust the reading sequence of child node which can be changed in the drop-down menu.
* Child role:  The next-level sub-item of the mathematical rule. Taking the fractional rule mfrac as an example, the rule contains the numerator and the denominator. The sub-content in the upper sub-content meaning can be changed in the child-node role field.

Example: You can check the reading method of this math rule after editing. After clicking, a math content is preset the corresponding math rules for confirming whether the reading method is as expected.

Recover default: Restores the list of math rules to their initial presets.

Import: Import math rules files, which can be used to load math rules files.

Export: Save the math rules file to the specified path to share or keep.

## example

Math contents in Wiki are all written by MathML.

* Quadratic equation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation
* Matrix multiplication: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication
* Cubic function: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_function

Quadratic equation

* LaTeX: \(ax^2+bx+c=0\)
