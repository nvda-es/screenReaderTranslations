"2. Type braille by pressing keys together on the PC keyboard as if it were a braille keyboard.\n"
"\t* If you want to enter text using two hands, use the following keys if you work with a QWERTY English keyboard, or the keys located at the corresponding positions in other layouts:\n"
"\t\t* f, d and s for dots 1, 2 and 3 respectively.\n"
"\t\t* j, k and l for dots 4, 5 and 6 respectively.\n"
"\t\t* Use the keys a and ; (semi-colon) for dots 7 and 8, respectively.\n"
"\t\t* You can also use the keys on the row above; i.e. q, w, e, r, u, i, o and p.\n"
"\t* If you want to type text using one hand, you can compose characters pressing keys simultaneously or in several keystrokes, adding the dots corresponding to the desired character. Press g or h to type the character when you have added all its dots. If you make a mistake building a character, you can clear the dots before typing it by pressing t or y. The keys used in QWERTY English keyboard are the following:\n"
"\t\t* Left hand: f, d, s, r, e, w, a, q for dots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.\n"
"\t\t* Right hand: j, k, l, u, i, o, ; (semicolon), p for dots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.\n"
"3. You can press most other keys as normal, including space, backspace, enter and function keys. Take care about not pressing alt+shift, since changing the keyboard layout may affect the entered dots.\n"
"4. Press space bar in combination with braille dots to move the system cursor (or report the current line), just if you were using a braille display. For example, space+dot1 to emulate upArrow, space+dot4+dot5+dot6 to emulate control+end, space+dot1+dot4 to report the current line, etc.\n"
"5. Press NVDA+0 to disable braille input.\n"

"Some keyboards, particularly laptop keyboards, cannot handle certain "
"combinations of keys being pressed.  When this happens, certain keys are "
"simply ignored.  Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done to fix "
"this, as the keys are simply never received by Windows or NVDA.  In some "
"cases, using the upper row of keys with either or both hands might help, as "
"your keyboard may allow these keys."
