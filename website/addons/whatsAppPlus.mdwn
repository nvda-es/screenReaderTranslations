## History of changes ##

### Version 1.9.0 ###

* Added a keyboard shortcut that opens a list of all WhatsAppPlus keyboard shortcuts. By default, this function is assigned to ALT+H gesture.
* Fixed a bug where ALT+2 and ALT+3 gestures didn't work.
* Fixed a bug where it was impossible to activate some functions from the context menu using gestures.
* Fixed an issue where changing voice message playback speed and pausing voice message playback did not always work.
* Fixed a bug where in chats when focusing on your sent messages, instead of the word "you", the screen reader announced a personal number. To avoid this, you need to specify the phone number in the WhatsAppPlus settings and after that the add-on will not report it on your messages.
* Fixed an issue where WhatsAppPlus prompted to update on secure screens. To prevent this from happening again, you need to click on the "Use currently saved settings during sign-in and on secure screens (requires administrator privileges)" button in the NVDA general settings.
* The gesture to accept a call has been changed to ALT+shift+Y, and the gesture to decline a call has been changed to ALT+shift+N. This is to ensure that these gestures do not conflict with UnigramPlus gestures.
* Microphone and camera on/off gestures during a call now work correctly.
* Removed gesture to set reaction to messages, since in the latest versions of WhatsApp, reactions are available directly from the context menu.

### Version 1.8.0 ###

* The add-on has been tested to ensure compatibility with NVDA-2023.
* Added a keyboard shortcut for selecting messages. To enter selection mode, press Ctrl+Space, and then use Space to select the next message.
* A new function has been added to automatically announce activity in an open chat. By default, this feature is enabled by double-pressing the ALT+T combination. This helps users stay up-to-date on new messages and other chat activity.
* The function that automatically announces new messages in the chat has been substantially revised for more stable operation. This ensures that users are alerted to new messages accurately and reliably.
* Added labels to some unsigned buttons.

### Version 1.7.0 ###

* Added a function that automatically announces the progress bar if the focus is on a message.
* Added keyboard shortcut to report progress bar value if focus is on a message. By default, the ALT+U key combination is assigned to this function. If this combination is pressed twice, the function of automatic announcing of performance indicators will be enabled.
* Fixed an issue where focus could not be moved to the chat list.
* Added labels to some elements.

### Version 1.6.0 ###

* Added ability to quickly reply to group members. To enter a message, it is enough to write the symbol "@" in the message entry field, use the up and down arrows to select who you want to reply to, and then press the Enter key.
* Added ability to quickly insert emoticons. To do this, you must write a colon and the name of the emoticon you want to find in the message input field. Later, use the left and right arrow keys to find the desired emoticon and use the Enter key to insert it into the message input field.
* In the WhatsAppPlus settings, an option has been added to enable the playback of sounds when recording, pausing and sending voice messages.
* Changed the keyboard shortcut for opening the profile of the current conversation to Control+Shift+P.
* Added Nepali localization.
* Fixed several bugs, including an issue where automatic reading of new messages in an open conversation was not working for some users.

### Version 1.5.0 ###

* Added a keyboard shortcut to change the speed of the voice message being played. The default gesture is ctrl+s. The gesture will only work when a voice message is playing in an open chat.

* You can now open links attached to messages with the spacebar
* Added labels for some interface elements

### Version 1.2.0 ###

* Now, when you focus on a message written in reply to another message, the text of that message will be spoken first and then the text of the message to which it was sent.
* The name and type of files sent in the conversation will now be spoken.
* ALT+1 now works even when the chat archive or the selected messages section is open.
* ALT + left arrow helps to close the chat archive or the selected messages list if they are open.
* Now, pressing control+D, in addition to cancelling voice messages, also cancels the reply to the message.
* Information about the inability to record a voice message will now be reported when the message input field is not empty. This will fix a problem where pressing control+R would send a text message instead of starting a voice message recording.
