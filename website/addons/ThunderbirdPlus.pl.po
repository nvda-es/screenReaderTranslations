"* Hearing comfort:\n"
"\t* \"so-and-so requested acknowledgment\" alerts can be disabled via an "
"option;\n"
"\t* \"This is a draft\" and \"Thunderbird thinks this message is "
"fraudulent\" alerts are simply ignored;\n"
"\t* Options make it possible to deactivate the announcement of the names of "
"mailing lists, to remove or group the mentions \"RE\" and to purify the "
"names of the correspondents by removing the numbers and other awkward "
"special characters;\n"
"* Improved navigation:\n"
"\t* Moving to the next panel is done using the TAB key while the escape key "
"allows you to return to the previous panel. This is more comfortable than F6 "
"and Shift+F6.\n"
"\t* Two dialogs of accounts and their associated folders allow filtering "
"them by keyword or displaying only folders with unread messages;\n"
"\t* In the folder tree, alt+down arrow and Alt+up arrow allow you to "
"navigate between folders with unread messages;\n"
"\t* Still in the folder tree, typing a letter or a number selects the next "
"folder whose name begins with the character typed. With the Shift key, the "
"move is from bottom to top. Additionally, the name of the account the folder "
"belongs to is announced;\n"
"\t* The Space key on a folder with unread messages selects the first unread "
"message in the list;\n"
"* In the message list:\n"
"\t* The choice of columns as well as their arrangement in the list of "
"messages is made accessible through a simple dialog;\n"
"\t* Consultation of the columns of the list of messages: allows you to "
"listen again, spell or easily copy the name of the sender, the subject or "
"the date of a message by pressing a number on the alphanumeric keyboard: for "
"example, 1 or & announces the sender, 2 presses spells the name and 3 "
"presses copies it to the clipboard;\n"
"\t* Consultation of the headers of the headers pane displayed with F8: with "
"Alt+a number, 1 press speaks a header containing the addresses of the sender "
"or the recipients, 2 presses opens a dialog allowing them to be copied, 3 "
"presses opens the contextual menu native Thunderbird associated with the "
"header;\n"
"\t* Clean quick preview of message text with space, Alt+down arrow or F4: "
"large block headers in message quotes are replaced with the phrase "
"\"Sender's name wrote\". NVDA will also announce \"clickable link\" instead "
"of the long link address.\n"
"\t* Quick view of quotes in their chronological order, from bottom to top, "
"via Shift+Space, Alt+up arrow or Shift+F4;\n"
"\t* Easy access to attachments using the shortcut Alt+pageDown or the number "
"1 on the alpha-numeric keyboard;\n"
"\t* Quick filter bar made accessible and priority tag management "
"simplified:\n"
"\t\t* It is possible to navigate among Filter options using the vertical "
"arrow keys. The Enter key allows you to check or uncheck an option ;\n"
"\t\t* Adding or removing priority tags is done by simply pressing Shift+a "
"number on the alphanumeric keyboard. For example, press 4 to add the tag "
"\"To do\" to a message. You can then filter the list of messages by tags via "
"the quick filter bar which is now accessible;\n"
"* Compose message window:\n"
"\t* Alt+1 announces Sender, Alt+2 receiver, Alt+3 attachments, etc. Two "
"presses set  the focus on one of these fields;\n"
"\t* In the spell check dialog:\n"
"\t\t* the misspelled word is announced before the suggested word. NVDA+Tab "
"or Alt+up arrow shortcuts announce misspelled and replacement words: 1 tap "
"spells the words at normal speed, 2 taps spells them fast, 3 taps copies the "
"misspelled word to the clipboard for analysis in another edit field;\n"
"\t\t* various combinations of the enter key activate the buttons Replace, "
"Replace all, Ignore, Ignore all or Add the word to the dictionary have been "
"added for an increased comfort of this dialog;\n"
"* Automatic extension update;\n"
"* And many other things that you will discover by reading the [user "
"manual][4] ;\n"
