TextNav allows you to find text that you want to read on a web page in just a single keystroke.
More precisely, it adds a keystroke to jump to next or previous text paragraphs - that is a paragraph containing one or more sentences.
This feature might be useful to quickly find the textual part of a web page or to skip over menus, advertisements and other not important page elements.

## Keystrokes: 
* Alt+Shift+Down arrow: Go to next text paragraph.
* Alt+Shift+Up arrow: Go to previous text paragraph.
