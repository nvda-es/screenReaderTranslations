TextNav allows you to find text that you want to read on a web page 
in just a single keystroke.
More precisely, it adds a keystroke to jump to next or previous 
text paragraphs - that is a paragraph containing one or more sentences.
This feature might be useful to quickly find the textual part of a 
web page or to skip over menus, advertisements and other not important 
page elements.
Keystrokes:
    * Alt+Shift+Down: Go to next text paragraph.
    * Alt+Shift+Up: Go to previous text paragraph.
