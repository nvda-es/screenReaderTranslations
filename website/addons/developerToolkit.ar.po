"The NVDA developer toolkit assists blind and visually impaired developers "
"with the difficult task of creating appealing visual layouts for any "
"software or web development project. Currently, it provides the location of "
"objects on the visible portion of the screen. The addon provides the "
"location in pixels. The anchor for each object is the top left corner in "
"relation to the top left corner of the window or screen. For example, if the "
"addon reports left: 15, top: 100, this means that the object with focus is "
"15 pixels from the left edge of the screen and 100 pixels from the top edge "
"of the screen. The width and height of the control is also provided in "
"pixels. This accounts for the content, padding, and margins of each control "
"involved."
