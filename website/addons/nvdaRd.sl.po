"This add-on adds support to access remote desktop sessions to NVDA using "
"Microsoft Remote Desktop, Citrix or VMware Horizon.  When installed in NVDA "
"on both the client and the server, speech and braille generated on the "
"server will be spoken and brailled by the client machine.  This enables a "
"user experience where managing a remote system feels just as performant as "
"operating the local system."
