This add-on enables the advanced clock, alarm timer and calendar functionality for NVDA.

You can configure NvDA to announce time and date in formats other than what Windows provides by default. Additionally, you can obtain the current day, week number, as well as the remaining days before the end of the current year, and you can also set automatic time announcement on specified interval. There's also a stopwatch and Alarm timer features built-in to the add-on that lets you time your tasks, such as copying files, installing programs, or cooking meals.

Notes:

* if you install the add-on as an update, during the installation process, the wizard detects if the old configuration is compatible with the new one and offers to correct it before installing, then you'll just have to validate the OK button to confirm that.
* On Windows 10 and later, you can use Alarms and Clock app to manage stopwatch and timers.

## Key commands

* NVDA+F12: get current time
* NVDA+F12 pressed twice quickly: get current date
* NVDA+F12 pressed three times quickly: reports the current day, the week number, the current year and the remaining days before the end of the year
* NVDA+Shift+F12: enter clock layer

## Configuration and usage

To configure clock functionality, open NvDA menu, Preferences, then Settings, and configure the following options from Clock panel:

* Time and date display format: use these combo boxes to configure how NVDA will announce time and date when you press NVDA+F12 once or twice quickly, respectively.
* Interval: choose the time announcement interval from this combo box (off, every 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or every hour).
* Time announcement (enabled if interval is not off): choose between speech and sound, sound only, or speech only.
* Clock chime sound (enabled if interval is not off): select the clock chime sound.
* Quiet hours (enabled if interval is not off): select this checkbox to configure quiet hours range when automatic time announcement should not occur.
* Input in 24-hour format (only visible if quiet hours are enabled) allows you to configure whether you want to input time for quiet hours in 12-hour (A.M. or P.M.), or european 24-hour format.
* The Edit box controls for start and end time (only visible if quiet hours are enabled) let you configure time range for quiet hours. The time should be entered in HH:MM format if the "input in 24-hour format" checkbox is checked, otherwise you must use a 12 hour format as described below.

When done, tab to the OK button and activate it by pressing Enter to save your settings.

To schedule alarms, open NVDA menu, Preferences, then Settings, and configure the following options from Alarm panel:

* In the Alarm setup dialog, the first Combo Box control allow you to choose your prefered countdown timer before the alarm ring.
* The Edit box control lets you type your time waiting before the alarm ring. This duration must be specified in 1 or more digits, not a decimal number.
* The Combo box control labeled "Alarm sound" lets you choose between various alarm sounds that will be played when the alarm time arrives.
* The pause button allows you to pause/resume too long alarms.
* The stop button allows you to stop too long alarms.

When done, tab to the OK button and activate it by pressing Enter. A message should be displayed to remind you of the waiting time before the alarm.

## Syntax to use for quiet hours

1. To avoid bugs, the quiet hours must follow a rigorous and precise syntax.
2. If you check the "Input in 24-hour format" checkbox, the format must be "HH:MM".
3. If you uncheck the "Input in 24-hour format" checkbox, the format must be "HH:MM AM" or "HH:MM PM", the HH must contain a 12-hour format, from 0 to 12 and the "AM"|"PM" suffix can be in lowercase or uppercase.
4. If you check the Quiet hours" checkbox and keep the "Quiet hours start time" or "Quiet hours end time" field empty, or type a mistaken value, the "Quiet hours" checkbox will be unchecked automatically to avoid errorss and a message will be displayed.
