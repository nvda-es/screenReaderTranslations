This addon enables the advanced clock, alarm timer and calendar functionality for NVDA.

Instead of always getting time and date from Windows, you can customize how times and dates should be spoken and brailled by NVDA.

Additionally, you can obtain the current day, week number, as well as the remaining days before the end of the current year, and you can also set automatic time announcement on specified interval.

There's also a stopwatch and Alarm timer features built-in to the addon, that lets you time your tasks, such as copying files, installing programs, or cooking meals.

## Note:

If you install the add-on as an update, during the installation process, the wizard detects if the old configuration is compatible with the new one and offers to correct it before installing, then you'll just have to validate the OK button to confirm that.
