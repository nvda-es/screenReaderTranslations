"The normal functions of the PC number pad, with numlock off, are: page up, "
"page down, home, end, four-way arrow keys, and a delete key.  But NVDA "
"completely takes over the numpad, to provide review keys, mouse controls, "
"and object navigation controls. This is true even in laptop keyboard mode, "
"which duplicates those functions on non-numpad keys for those who do not "
"have a numpad."

"However some users do have a numpad on their laptop, and would prefer to use "
"it for Windows navigation purposes, especially because some laptops do not "
"provide home, end, or other such keys.  That is where this add-on can help.  "
"Additionally, some desktop users may sometimes find it convenient to use the "
"numpad for those keyboard functions rather than the normal keys, which this "
"add-on enables."

"With numlock off, no matter what keyboard layout you are using, this add-on "
"will let you press Alt+NVDA+NumpadPlus (which is usually the long key second "
"up on the right), to quickly and easily switch between the normal NVDA "
"navigation controls, and the classic Windows navigation controls. This key "
"can be remapped under Input Gestures, in the Input section."

"Note that this add-on doesn't disable the use of numpad insert as an NVDA "
"modifier, if you have it set as such. If you want that feature, please let "
"me know, although you can manually turn off numpad insert as a modifier in "
"NVDA keyboard settings."

"If you would prefer to have NVDA start with the Windows nav mode active by "
"default, you can configure that in NVDA configuration.  Go to NVDA's "
"preferences, then settings, and find the Numpad Nav Mode settings panel.  "
"There you will be able to select a checkbox to turn Windows Nav Mode on by "
"default when you start NVDA.  To get there quickly, press NVDA+N, P, S, then "
"N one or more times until you hear \"Numpad Nav Mode\"."
