"This add-on allows you to download and install the latest NVDA version of "
"the chosen type without visiting any webpage nor using your web browser. It "
"is useful when, for example, you want to test new features in a NVDA "
"snapshot and then return back to the most recent stable release. If you test "
"regularly NVDA snapshots and you usually install them in your computer, you "
"will save a lot of time with this add-on. If you prefer testing snapshots in "
"portable mode keeping your installed copy of NVDA unchanged, this add-on is "
"for you as well."
