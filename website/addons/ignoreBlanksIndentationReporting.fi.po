"The current behaviour of NVDA is to report indentation changes for any line "
"where the indentation has changed, even if the line is blank. So, the "
"example would be read like:"

#. type: Plain text
#, no-wrap
msgid ""
"def foo():\n"
"tab x = 42\n"
"no indent blank\n"
"tab return x\n"

"The disadvantage for this behaviour is that for most programming languages, "
"like python, a blank line has no semantic significance and is just used to "
"visually separate lines of code with no change to the code's meaning. "
"Therefore, by reporting the change of indentation upon entering a blank line "
"and then reporting it again after landing on the next line is just noise "
"that makes it harder to focus on understanding the code."
