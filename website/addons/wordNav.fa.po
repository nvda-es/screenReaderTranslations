"WordNav NVDA add-on improves built-in navigation by word, as well as adds "
"extra word navigation commands with different definition for the word."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Most text editors support Control+LeftArrow/RightArrow commands for word "
"navigation. However the definition of the word changes from one program to "
"another. This is especially true of modern web-based text editors, such as "
"Monaco. NVDA should know the definition of word in given program in order to "
"speak words correctly. If NVDA doesn't know the exact definition, then "
"either words are going to be skipped, or pronounced multiple "
"times. Moreover, some web-based text editors position the cursor in the end "
"of the word, instead of the beginning, making editing much harder for "
"visually impaired users. In order to combat this problem I have created "
"enhanced word navigation commands, that take the word definition from "
"Notepad++ and they do not rely on program's definition of words, but rather "
"parse lines into words on NVDA's side. The Control+LeftArrow/RightArrow "
"gesture is not even sent to the program, thus ensuring the consistency of "
"the speech."

"Currently WordNav supports four definitions of the word, assigned to "
"different gestures:"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"- `Left Control+Arrows`: Notepad++ definition, that treats alphanumeric "
"characters as words, and adjacent punctuation marks are also treated as "
"words. This should be the most convenient word definition for the majority "
"of users.  - `RightControl+Arrows`: Fine word definition splits "
"`camelCaseIdentifiers` and `underscore_separated_identifiers` into separate "
"parts, thus allowing the cursor to go into long identifiers.  - "
"`LeftControl+Windows+Arros`: Bulky word definition treats almost all "
"punctuation symbols adjacent to text as part of a single word, therefore it "
"would treat paths like `C:\\directory\\subdirectory\\file.txt` as a single "
"word.  - `RightControl+Windows+Arros`: Multiword definition, that groups "
"several words together. The amount of words is configurable."

"- At this time WordNav doesn't modify `Control+Shift+LeftArrow/RightArrow` "
"gestures to select words, since implementation of such commands are "
"significantly more complicated.  - If you would like to use virtual desktops "
"feature of Windows 10, please remember to disable Control+Windows+Arrows "
"keyboard shortcuts either in WordNav Settings panel, or in NVDA Input "
"gestures dialog.  - WordNav doesn't work reliably in VSCode, since due to "
"its internal optimizations, VSCode presents only a few lines of file "
"contents at a time, that change dynamically, and this occasionally "
"interferes with WordNav algorithm."
