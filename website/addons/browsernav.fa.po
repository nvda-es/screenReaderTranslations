"This add-on provides NVDA users powerful navigation commands in browser "
"mode.  For example, with BrowserNav you can find vertically aligned "
"paragraphs, that is paragraphs with the same horizontal offset. This can be "
"used to read hierarchical trees of comments or malformed HTML tables.  You "
"can also find paragraphs written in the same font size or style.  BrowserNav "
"also provides new QuickNav commands: P for next paragraph and Y for next "
"tab."

"BrowserNav can be used to navigate by horizontal offset from the left edge "
"of the screen, by font size, or by font style.  * When navigating by "
"horizontal offset, you can easily find paragraphs that are vertically "
"aligned on the page. IN particular, you can press NVDA+Alt+DownArrow or "
"UpArrow to jump to the next or previous paragraph that has the same "
"offset. For example, this can be useful when browsing hierarchical trees of "
"comments (e.g. on reddit.com) to jump between first level comments and "
"skipping all the higher level comments.  * When navigating by font size, you "
"can easily find paragraphs written in the same font size, or smaller/greater "
"font size.  * You can also navigate by font size with the constraint of same "
"font style."
