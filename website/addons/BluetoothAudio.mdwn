   Bluetooth Audio is an NVDA add-on that improves sound quality when 
working with bluetooth headphones or speakers.
   Most bluetooth devices enter standby mode after a few seconds of 
inactivity. That means that when NVDA starts speaking again, the first 
split second of sound will be lost. Bluetooth Audio add-on prevents 
bluetooth devices from entering standby mode by constantly playing a 
silent sound, that is inaudible to a human ear.
   Warning: using Bluetooth Audio add-on might reduce battery life of 
your bluetooth device.
