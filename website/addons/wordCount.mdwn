## Use ##
This addon announces the number of words, characters, paragraphs and lines of the selected text by pressing Control+Shift+F12.

Note: In some applications, like Word, WordPad and DSpeech, it only announces word and characters, to avoid hanging NVDA.

In any text editor, or in a virtual document, for example in a web browser, PDF, email body, etc., select the desired text using the usual text selection commands and press Control+Shift+F12.

This command can be modified in the "Input gestures" dialog in the "Text editing" section.
