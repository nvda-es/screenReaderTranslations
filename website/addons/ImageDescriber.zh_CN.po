"Notes: * The shortcut to get an image description of the current navigator "
"object is NVDA+Control+I.  * If you configure another language than English, "
"the description could have translation issues because it's automatically "
"generated.  * The language of the descriptions that are generated are linked "
"with the configured NVDA language. In other words, if you have Swedish "
"configured, you will get Swedish descriptions, unless you change the "
"language in the Image describer settings.  * You can change the shortcut in "
"the Input gestures menu, under the Image describer category."
