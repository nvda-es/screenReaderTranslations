"MathCAT is designed to eventually replace MathPlayer because MathPlayer is "
"no longer supported. MathCAT generates speech and braille from MathML. The "
"speech for math produced by MathCAT is enhanced with prosody so that it "
"sounds more natural. The speech can be navigated in three modes using the "
"same commands as MathPlayer. In addition, the navigation node is indicated "
"on a braille display. Both Nemeth and UEB technical are supported."

"MathCAT has a number of configuration options that control speech, "
"navigation, and braille.  Many of these can be set in the MathCAT settings "
"dialog (found NVDA Preferences menu).  For more information on these "
"settings, see the [MathCAT documentation](https://nsoiffer.github.io/MathCAT/"
"users.html).  The documentation includes a link to [a table listing all of "
"the navigation commands in MathCAT](https://nsoiffer.github.io/MathCAT/nav-"

"MathCAT's rules for speech are not yet as extensive as MathPlayer's rules -- "
"that may be another reason to stick with MathPlayer. MathCAT is being used "
"as a testbed for ideas for MathML 4 that allow authors to express their "
"intent so that ambiguous notations can be spoken correctly and not guessed "
"at. I have held off on adding too many rules since the architecture of "
"MathCAT is centered around using and inferring author intent and these are "
"not fully settled yet."

"This release has a number of bug fixes in it. The major new features and bug "
"fixes are: * Added Spanish Translation (thanks to Noelia Ruiz and María Allo "
"Roldán)  * Modified navigation so that it starts zoomed in one level * Added "
"cntrl+alt+arrow as a way to navigate tabular structures. These keys should "
"be more memorable because they are used for table navigation in NVDA.  * "
"Worked around NVDA bug for eSpeak voices that caused them to slow down when "
"the relative MathRate was set to be slower than the text speech rate.  * "
"Worked around a OneCore voice problem so that they will speak the long 'a' "
"sound."
