"MathCAT is designed to eventually replace MathPlayer because MathPlayer is "
"no longer supported. MathCAT generates speech and braille from MathML. The "
"speech for math produced by MathCAT is enhanced with prosody so that it "
"sounds more natural. The speech can be navigated in three modes using the "
"same commands as MathPlayer. In addition, the navigation node is indicated "
"on a braille display. Both Nemeth and UEB technical are supported."

"MathCAT adds a settings menu to NVDA's preferences menu. In the settings "

"MathCAT's rules for speech are not yet as extensive as MathPlayer's rules -- "
"that may be another reason to stick with MathPlayer. MathCAT is being used "
"as a testbed for ideas for MathML 4 that allow authors to express their "
"intent so that ambiguous notations can be spoken correctly and not guessed "
"at. I have held off on adding too many rules since the architecture of "
"MathCAT is centered around using and inferring author intent and these are "
"not fully settled yet."
