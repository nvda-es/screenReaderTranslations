## Sound Splitter settings

You can configure add-on settings from NVDA menu/Preferences/Settings/Sound Splitter category.

* Split NVDA sound and applications' sounds into left and right channels: checkinb this checkbox will enable sound splitting feature.
* Switch left and right during sound split: by default, NVDA will be heard through the right channel if sound splitting is on. You can instead hear NVDA through the left channel by checking this checkbox.

## Version 22.02

* Initial version based on Tony Malykh's Tony's Enhancements add-on.
