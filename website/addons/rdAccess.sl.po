"The RDAccess add-on (Remote Desktop Accessibility) adds support to access "
"remote desktop sessions to NVDA using Microsoft Remote Desktop, Citrix or "
"VMware Horizon.  When installed in NVDA on both the client and the server, "
"speech and braille generated on the server will be spoken and brailled by "
"the client machine.  This enables a user experience where managing a remote "
"system feels just as performant as operating the local system."
