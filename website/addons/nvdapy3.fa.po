"Released in 2000, Python 2.x is one of the most popular programming "
"languages. With support for Unicode, web technologies, and thousands of "
"third-party libraries, Python became a language of choice for many projects, "
"including NVDA in 2006."

"In late 2000's, Python developers announced Python 3000, a project to "
"modernize Python. Changes were made to Python syntax, standard library, and "
"other underlying framework, including the print function, more comprehensive "
"support for Unicode, changes to standard library, and changing iteration "
"methods such as xrange to range. Although Python 3.x did modernize Python "
"programming language, due to large-scale deployment of Python 2, Python "
"developers decided to support Python 2.7 (the last version of Python 2) "
"until January 2020 to give people time to move to Python 3."

"Threshold builds of NVDA in July 2019, which is based on Python 3.7 and "
"includes a host of changes in addition to Python 3 transition such as speech "
"refactor, which will affect add-ons."
