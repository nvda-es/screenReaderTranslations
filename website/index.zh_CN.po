"additional packages that can be downloaded and installed into your copy of "
"NVDA to enhance existing functionality or add additional features.  These "
"add-ons may include additional features and commands that can be used "
"everywhere, enhancing support for a program, or add support for a new "
"braille display or a speech synthesizer."

"Once you press Open, or press Enter on the add-on file, NVDA will ask if you "
"really wish to install the add-on, provided that it is compatible with the "
"NVDA version you are using.  As the functionality of add-ons is unrestricted "
"inside NVDA, which in theory could include accessing your personal data or "
"even the entire system if NVDA is an installed copy, it is very important to "
"only install add-ons from sources you trust.  Once the add-on is installed, "
"NVDA must be restarted for the add-on to start running."

"一旦您按下“回车”键或者选择“打开”， NVDA 将询问您是否真的要安装此插件。这些插"
