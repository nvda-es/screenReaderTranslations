    Fix root certificate update. (PR #11253)
    
    Fixes updateCheck._updateWindowsRootCertificates() for Python 3.
    
    This was missed in the migration to Python 3.
    There are two problems that needed to be addressed here:
    
    1. We use https://www.nvaccess.org/nvdaUpdateCheck as the URL to get the certificate. However, that returns a 404. In Python 2, urllib didn't raise an exception for errors. In Python 3, it does. So, this was raising an exception and preventing us from getting any further.
        To fix this, pass versionType=stable as the query string, which will stop the server from throwing 404.
    2. When getting the peer certificate, we need the raw SSL socket. In Python 3, the way to get that raw socket has changed slightly, so this code had to be adjusted accordingly.
