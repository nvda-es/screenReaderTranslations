+
+This quick start guide contains three main sections: downloading, initial setup, and running NVDA.
+These are followed by information on adjusting preferences, participating in the community and getting help.
+The information in this guide is condensed from other parts of the NVDA User Guide.
+Please refer to the full User Guide for more detailed information on each topic.
+
+++ Downloading NVDA ++[GettingAndSettingUpNVDA]
+NVDA is completely free for anyone to use.
+There is no license key to worry about or expensive subscription to pay.
+NVDA is updated, on average, four times per year.
+The latest version of NVDA is always available from the "Download" page of the [NV Access website NVDA_URL].
+
+NVDA works with all recent versions of Microsoft Windows.
+Check the [System Requirements #SystemRequirements] for full details.
+
++++ Steps for Downloading NVDA +++[StepsForDownloadingNVDA]
 
-Go to the download section and you will find a link to download the latest version of NVDA.
+These steps assume some familiarity with navigating a web page.
+
+- Open your web browser (Press the ``Windows`` key, type the word "internet" without quotes, and press ``enter``)
+- Load the NV Access download page (Press ``alt+d``, type the following address and press ``enter``): 
+https://www.nvaccess.org/download 
+- Activate the "download" button
+- The browser may or may not prompt for an action after downloading, and then start the download
+- Depending on the browser, the file may run automatically after it downloads
+- If the file needs to be manually launched, press ``alt+n`` to move to the notification area, then ``alt+r`` to run the file (or the steps for your browser)
+-
+
+++ Setting up NVDA ++[SettingUpNVDA]
 
 Running the file you have just downloaded will start a temporary copy of NVDA.
 You will then be asked if you want to install NVDA, create a portable copy or just continue using the temporary copy.
 
-If you plan to  always use NVDA on this computer, you will want to choose to install NVDA.
-Installing NVDA will allow for additional functionality such as automatic starting after sign-in, the ability to read the Windows sign-in and [secure screens #SecureScreens] (which cannot be done with portable and temporary copies) and creation of Start Menu and desktop shortcuts.
-The installed copy is also able to create a portable copy itself at any time.
+NVDA does not need access to the Internet to run or install once the launcher is downloaded.
+If available, an internet connection does enable NVDA to check for updates periodically.
 
-If you want to take NVDA with you on a USB thumb drive or other writable  media, then you  should choose to create a portable copy.
-The portable copy also has the ability to install itself on any computer at a later time.
-However, if you wish to copy NVDA onto read-only media such as a CD, you should just copy the download package.
-Running the portable version directly from read-only media is not supported at this time.
++++ Steps for running the downloaded launcher +++[StepsForRunningTheDownloadLauncher]
 
-Using the temporary copy of NVDA is also an option (e.g. for demonstration purposes), though  starting NVDA in this way each time can become very time consuming.
+The setup file is named "nvda_2022.1.exe" or similar.
+The year and version changes between updates to reflect the current release.
++ Run the downloaded file.
+Music plays while a temporary copy of NVDA loads.
+Once loaded, NVDA will speak throughout the rest of the process.

-++ Portable and Temporary Copy Restrictions ++[PortableAndTemporaryCopyRestrictions]
-Apart from the  inability to automatically start during and/or after log-on, the portable and temporary copies of NVDA also have the following restrictions:
-- The inability to interact with applications running with administrative privileges, unless of course NVDA itself has been run also with these privileges (not recommended).
-- The inability to read User Account Control (UAC) screens when trying to start an application with administrative privileges.
-- Windows 8 and later: the inability to support input from a touchscreen.
-- Windows 8 and later: the inability to provide features such as browse mode and speaking of typed characters in Windows Store apps.
-- Windows 8 and later: audio ducking is not supported.
+The options are: 
+- "Install NVDA on this computer": This is the main option most users want for easy use of NVDA. 
+- "Create portable copy": This allows NVDA to be setup in any folder without installing.
+This is useful on computers without admin rights, or on a memory stick to carry with you.
+When selected, NVDA walks through the steps to create a portable copy.
+The main thing NVDA needs to know is the folder to setup the portable copy in. 
+- "Continue running": This keeps the temporary copy of NVDA running.
+This is useful for testing features in a new version before installing it.
+When selected, the launcher window closes and the temporary copy of NVDA continues running until it is exited or the PC is shut down.

+- Automatic: "selective" on Windows 11 Sun Valley 2 (version 22H2) and later, "global" otherwise.
+- Selective: NVDA will limit event registration to the system focus for most events.
 If you suffer from performance issues in one or more applications, We recommend you to try this functionality to see whether performance improves.
+However, on older versions of Windows, NVDA may have trouble tracking focus in some controls (such as the task manager and emoji panel).
+- Global: NVDA registers for many UIA events that are processed and discarded within NVDA itself.
+While focus tracking is more reliable in more situations, performance is significantly degraded, especially in applications like Microsoft Visual Studio.
