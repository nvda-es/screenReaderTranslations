    Teams: No longer inappropriately focus reaction menus when conversation messages are focused. (#14363)
    
    Fixes #14355
    Broadens approach from pr #11822 which was to fix #11821.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When a conversation message is focused in Microsoft Teams (E.g. arrowing up and down a threaded conversation list) Teams displays a reaction menu along side the focused message. As Chromium therefore fires a menu popupStart event, NVDA handles this by faking focus on the menu itself
    This behaviour has been historically necessary for win32 context menus that fail to focus the first item in the menu.
    However, In Teams this is very disruptive.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA will no longer get stuck in a menu when arrowing up and down threaded conversations in Microsoft Teams.
    
    Description of development approach
    Broaden the approach taken in pr #11821 by suppressing handling of menu popupStart for any element in teams with 'menu' in its xml-roles attribute. Previously NVDA would also check for very particular message container classes on the parent's parent. But as Teams keeps moving these, this is no longer managable.
