    Extend the life of deprecated aliases (#13791)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    For deprecated aliases, there is no need to remove them, as they have a minimum maintenance burden.
    Add-on authors and contributors have requested we keep aliases where possible.
    
    However, without marking code for removal, it can be hard to find deprecations.
    Core contributors and add-on authors may want to avoid deprecated APIs.
    As such, a way to test the deprecated API being removed is needed.
    
    Description of how this pull request fixes the issue:
    Extends the life of all currently deprecated aliases.
    Warnings will be logged when attempting to use deprecated aliases (except for controlTypes, due to the noise of this).
    Adds a global variable to mark code as deprecated, which allows developers to test NVDA with deprecated APIs removed.
    
    As a result, there is currently no API breakages staged for 2023.1
