    Fixes the announcement of cell formatting commands in Excel (#15527)
    
    Fixes #15506
    Fix-up of #14923
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When peforming tests for #14923, I have wrongly assumed that Excel cell formatting shortcuts were control+shift+2/3/4/5. This assumption was based on my tests with Excel's interface changed to English on my system. However, it seems that the keyboard layout when Excel is started has also an impact on the shortcuts containing digits (see discussion in #14923).
    The actual shortcuts are control+2/3/4/5, as described in Microsoft documentation and as confirmed starting Excel with English GUI and English keyboard layout.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    On English systems (and probably many others), Excel cell formatting shortcuts control+2/3/4/5 will have their effect reported correctly. shift+control+2/3/4/5 will not report inappropriately formatting information on English systems.
    
    Description of development approach
    Modified the gesture definition.
