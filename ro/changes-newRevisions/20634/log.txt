    * Merge pull request from GHSA-xc5m-v23f-pgr7
    
    Unauthenticated users can modify NVDAs system profile for symbol pronunciation. This affects all users first (sign-on) interaction with the system. This action is intended to be limited to signed in users with administrator privileges.
    If unexpected symbols are being replaced, a user may experience a denial of service. For example, being unable to sign-in to Windows.
    
    The symbol pronunciation dialog is disabled in secure mode
    
    1. Assign a gesture to "Shows the NVDA symbol pronunciation dialog".
    2. Copy the config to secure screens via General Preferences
    3. Run NVDA in secure mode with `-s`
    4. Use the input gesture, note that the dialog is not opened
    
    * Update changes for 2021.3.5
