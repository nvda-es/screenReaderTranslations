+
+
+== Bug Fixes ==
+- Adobe Acrobat / Reader 64 bit will no longer crash when reading a PDF document. (#12920)

+- In builds of Windows Console (``conhost.exe``) with an NVDA API level of 2 (``FORMATTED``) or greater, such as those included with Windows 11 version 22H2 (Sun Valley 2), UI Automation is now used by default. (#10964)
+  - This can be overridden by changing the "Windows Console support" setting in NVDA's advanced settings panel.
+  - To find your Windows Console's NVDA API level, set "Windows Console support" to "UIA when available", then check the NVDA+F1 log opened from a running Windows Console instance.
