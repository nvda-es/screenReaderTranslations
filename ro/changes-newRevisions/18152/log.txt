    Fix setting focus when forcing focus mode (PR #11206)
    
    Browse mode with 'auto focus focusable elements' disabled: Focus focusable ancestor at caret when forcing focus mode with NVDA+space.
    
    When enabling (forcing) focus mode with NVDA+space, NVDA wasn't setting focus to the element under the cursor with 'auto focus focusable elements' disabled.
    
    Switching to focus mode with NVDA+space sets disableAutoPassThrough to True on the TreeInterceptor. Previously, this was just a variable. Now, it's a property which calls _focusLastFocusableObject() if appropriate.
