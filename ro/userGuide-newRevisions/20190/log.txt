    Revert UI a in ms word by default (#12989)
    
    We have tried to switch to using UI automation to access MS Word documents by default in NVDA 2021.3. However, there are still several issues remaining with our UIA support. Switching to UIA by default should be held back until these are addressed.
    Some of these include:
    • Support for math: Support mathML UIA custom property in MS Word #12946
    • Reporting of line numbers: Requires UIA custom patterns support\
    Over the last couple of months our UIA support has had a lot of fixes and improvements, mainly spured on by the apparent need to switch due to NVDA and MS Word not playing well together with the introduction of Modern Comments in MS Word build 13901. However, a work around has been found for #12982 now, making the swich less of a high priority.
