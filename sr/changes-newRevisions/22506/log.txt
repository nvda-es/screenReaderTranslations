    Add SysListView32 to badUIAWindowClassNames (#15542)
    
    Fixes #15541
    Reverts #15295
    Reopens #15283
    
    See also #15503, #15333
    
    Summary of the issue:
    There are several known cases where UIA is not correctly supported for SysListView32.
    Reliability History is the most recently raised, with task manager and management console being raised earlier.
    As this is close to a beta, it is safer to just declare SysListView32 as bad for UIA for all applications.
