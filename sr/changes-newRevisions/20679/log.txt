    Restore controlTypes aliases (PR #13588)
    
    fixes #13583
    
    Summary of issue:
    ControlTypes was refactored, aliases were left in place deprecated and then removed in the 2022.1 release.
    During the beta NV Access received feedback from add-on authors that updating usages of these aliases is difficult and feels unnecessary.
    
    Description of this change:
    Upon reconsideration, assessing the maintenance cost as low, these aliases have been reintroduced.
    Note, these aliases remain deprecated, and will be removed if maintenance cost becomes high.
    
    It is still recommended that add-on authors use the new controlTypes.Role and controlTypes.State symbols instead for consistency with the NVDA core code.
