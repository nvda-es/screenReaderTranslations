    Follow-up of various issues.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Some of the GitHub references in the change log were targetting wrong issue or PR.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    The references have been fixed in the change log document.
    
    Description of development approach
    Fixed the following references:
    
    Fixup of PR 13082: fix a misspell in DefaultAppArgs and no longer use globalVars.appArgs in a boolean context (#13386) #13386 replaced by Windows 10/11 Calculator: allow NVDA to announce more operations by suppressing only a limited number of keyboard commands #13383
    Revert "Update to py2exe 0.11.0.1 (#13066)" #13508 replaced by Windows 11 Design Elements Are Not Reported by NVDA When Mouse Tracking Is On #13506
    Fixup of PR 13082: fix a misspell in DefaultAppArgs and no longer use globalVars.appArgs in a boolean context (#13386) #13386 (bis) replaced by Windows 11 Notepad: status bar is not announced #13688
    Also, I have replaced #13276 (Libre Office issue) by #13277 (associated PR) since the issue description is not related at all with the change for developers.
