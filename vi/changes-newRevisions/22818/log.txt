    Esp32 microcontroller is not handled as Albatross display (#15928)
    
    fixes #15671
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Albatross driver handled Esp32 microcontroller as Albatross display if controller send valid init packet. This is problem especially when displays are detected automatically.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    When using usb connection, driver can check that bus reported device description is "Albatross Braille Display". Esp32 is not detected automatically as Albatross.
    
    Description of development approach
    _searchPorts function blocks port if VID and PID are correct but bus reported bus reported device description is not "Albatross Braille Display", in other cases port is valid to try to connect.
