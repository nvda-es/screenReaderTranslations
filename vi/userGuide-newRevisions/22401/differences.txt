 The hope is that all future Braille Display models created by any manufacturer, will use this standard protocol which will remove the need for manufacturer-specific Braille drivers.

 You can pass as many options as you need.
 These options can be passed when starting from a shortcut (in the shortcut properties), from the Run dialog (Start Menu -> Run or Windows+r) or from a Windows command console.
 Options should be separated from the name of NVDA's executable file and from other options by spaces.
-For example, a useful option is --disable-addons, which tells NVDA to suspend all running add-ons.
+For example, a useful option is ``--disable-addons``, which tells NVDA to suspend all running add-ons.
 This allows you to determine whether a problem is caused by an add-on and to recover from serious problems caused by add-ons.
 
 As an example, you can exit the currently running copy of NVDA by entering the following in the Run dialog:
 
+```
 nvda -q
+```
 
 Some of the command line options have a short and a long version, while some of them have only a long version.
 For those which have a short version, you can combine them like this:
-| nvda -mc CONFIGPATH | This will start NVDA with startup sounds and message disabled, and the specified configuration |
-| nvda -mc CONFIGPATH --disable-addons | Same as above, but with add-ons disabled |
+|`` nvda -mc CONFIGPATH`` | This will start NVDA with startup sounds and message disabled, and the specified configuration |
+| ``nvda -mc CONFIGPATH --disable-addons`` | Same as above, but with add-ons disabled |
 
 Some of the command line options accept additional parameters; e.g. how detailed the logging should be or the path to the user configuration directory.
-Those parameters should be placed after the option, separated from the option by a space when using the short version or an equals sign (=) when using the long version; e.g.:
-| nvda -l 10 | Tells NVDA to start with log level set to debug |
-| nvda --log-file=c:\nvda.log | Tells NVDA to write its log to c:\nvda.log |
-| nvda --log-level=20 -f c:\nvda.log | Tells NVDA to start with log level set to info and to write its log to c:\nvda.log |
