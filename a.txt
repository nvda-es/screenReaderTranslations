 === New Features ===
-	* NVDA no longer fails to start on a system with no audio output devices. Obviously, a braille display or the Display synthesiser will need to be used for output in this case. (#425)
+	* NVDA no longer fails to start on a system with no audio output devices. Obviously, a braille display or the Silence synthesiser in conjunction with the Speech Viewer will need to be used for output in this case. (#425)
 	* A report landmarks checkbox has been added to the Document Formatting settings dialog which allows you to configure whether NVDA should announce landmarks in web documents. For compatibility with the previous release, the option is on by default.
-	* If speak command keys is enabled, NVDA will now announce the names of multimedia keys (e.g. play, stop, home page, etc.) when they are pressed. (#472)
+	* If speak command keys is enabled, NVDA will now announce the names of multimedia keys (e.g. play, stop, home page, etc.) on many keyboards when they are pressed. (#472)
 	* NVDA now announces the word being deleted when pressing control+backspace in controls that support it. (#491)
 	* Arrow keys can now be used in the Web formator window to navigate and read the text. (#452)
 	* NVDA better supports embedded editable (design mode) documents in Internet Explorer. (#402)
 
 === Changes ===
 	* The extremely verbose keyboard help message in the Windows 7 Start menu is no longer reported.
+	* The Display synth has now been replaced with a new Speech Viewer. To activate it, choose Speech Viewer from the Tools menu. The speech viewer can be used independently of what ever speech synthesizer you are using.
 
 === Bug Fixes ===

 	* In virtual buffers, row/column coordinates are now correctly read when you leave a table and then re-enter the same table cell without visiting another cell first; e.g. pressing upArrow then downArrow on the first cell of a table. (#378)
 	* Blank lines in Microsoft Word documents and  Microsoft HTML edit controls are now shown appropriatly on braille displays. Previously NVDA was displaying the current sentence on the display, not the current line for these situations. (#420)

 == 2009.1 ==
 Major highlights of this release include support for 64 bit editions of Windows; greatly improved support for Microsoft Internet Explorer and Adobe Reader documents; support for Windows 7; reading of the Windows logon, control+alt+delete and User Account Control (UAC) screens; and the ability to interact with Adobe Flash and Sun Java content on web pages. There have also been several significant stability fixes and improvements to the general user experience.
