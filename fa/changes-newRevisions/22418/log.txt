    Force disable older versions of tony's enhancements add-on with 2023.3 (#15402)
    
    Tony's enhancements version 1.51 and older prevents any speech from happening when WASAPI is enabled.
    This is due to the add-on relying on private API functions.
    Now that WASAPI is enabled by default, upgrading to 2023.3 resulting in silence should be avoided if possible.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    When updating to NVDA 2023.3, if tony's enhancement add-on is installed it will trigger the typical UX warning for upgrading to an API breaking release, where incompatible add-ons are force disabled.
    
    Description of development approach
    Force known versions of problematic add-ons to be considered disabled with 2023.3.
    This code should be cleaned up in 2024.1.
