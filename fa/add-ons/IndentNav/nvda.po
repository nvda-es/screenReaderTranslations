"Indentation Navigation addon.\n"
"It allows NVDA users to navigate by indentation level or offset of lines or "
"paragraphs.\n"
"In browsers it allows to quickly find paragraphs with the same offset from "
"the left edge of the screen, such as first level comments in a hierarchical "
"tree of comments.\n"
"Also while editing source code in many programming languages, it allows to "
"jump between the lines of the same indentation level, as well as quickly "
"find lines with greater or lesser indentation level."
