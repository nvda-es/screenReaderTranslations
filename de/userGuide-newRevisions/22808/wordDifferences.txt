+{++ Speech modes ++[SpeechModes]

The speech mode governs how screen content, notifications, responses to commands, and other output is spoken during operation of NVDA.
The default mode is "talk", which speaks in situations that are expected when using a screen reader.
However, under certain circumstances, or when running particular programs, you may find one of the other speech modes valuable.

The four available speech modes are:
- Talk (Default): NVDA will speak normally in reaction to screen changes, notifications, and actions such as moving the focus, or issuing commands.
- On-demand: NVDA will only speak when you use commands with a reporting function (e.g. report the title of the window); but it will not speak in reaction to actions such as moving the focus or the cursor.
- Off: NVDA will not speak anything, however unlike sleep mode, it will silently react to commands.
- Beeps: NVDA will replace normal speech with short beeps.
-

The Beeps mode may be useful when some very verbose output is scrolling in a terminal window, but you don't care what it is, only that it is continuing to scroll; or in other circumstances when the fact that there is output is more relevant than the output itself.

The On-demand mode may be valuable when you don't need constant feedback about what is happening on screen or on the computer, but you periodically need to check particular things using review commands, etc.
Examples include while recording audio, when using screen magnification, during a meeting or a call, or as an alternative to beeps mode.

A gesture allows cycling through the various speech modes:
%kc:beginInclude
|| Name | Key | Description |
| Cycle Speech Mode | ``NVDA+s`` | Cycles between speech modes. |
