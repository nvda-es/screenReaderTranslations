|Options |Default (Disabled), Enabled, Disabled|
|Default |Disabled|

When this option is enabled, unicode normalization is performed on the text that is spoken by NVDA.
This is beneficial when speaking characters that can be represented in several forms.
NVDA uses the NFKC (Normalization Form Compatibility Composition) algorithm, which provides the following benefits, among others:

1. The bold and italic versions of characters that are part of the unicode standard and are commonly used on social media are normalized to their most common compatible equivalent.
For example, the latin letter "h" can also be presented as "ùê°" (bold), "‚Ñé" (itallic), etc. but will always be spoken as "h" when normalization is enabled.
This aspect of normalization also aids in reading equations in the Microsoft Word equation editor.

1. Normalization to composed characters.
For example, the character "√º" (u with umlaut/diaeresis), a common character in languages like German and Turkish can be represented in two forms.
  1. One stand alone unicode character (√º)
  1. A decomposition into two characters (uÃà), namely the normal latin letter u and a diaeresis modifier
  Unicode normalization ensures that only one form will be used throughout all speech output, which is the one character variant.

1. Decomposition of some ligatures, Including "ƒ≥" (ligature ij) to their two letter form ("ij").

1. Stable ordering of modifiers in composite characters, for example in ancient Hebrew.

To toggle Unicode normalization from anywhere, please assign a custom gesture using the [Input Gestures dialog](#InputGestures).

##### Report "Normalized" when navigating by character {#SpeechReportNormalizedForCharacterNavigation}

This setting is a checkbox that, when checked, tells NVDA to explicitly report that a character is normalized when spoken as an individual character such as when spelling.
For example, when this option is enabled, spelling the character "ƒ≥" will pronounce it as "i j normalized".

Note that this setting is only available when "[Unicode normalization](#SpeechUnicodeNormalization)" is enabled.
