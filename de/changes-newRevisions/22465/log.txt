    Add-on store: Clear download cache where appropriate (#15471)
    
    Fixes #15469
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Cancelled/failed downloads from the add-on store are not cleared.
    This prevents future attempts at installation.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Users should now be able to install add-ons after cancelling or if the download fails
    
    Description of development approach
    Clear the download cache:
    
    when an add-on download fails/cancels
    when exiting the store
    when opening the store
