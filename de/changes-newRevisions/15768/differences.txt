+= 2019.1 =
+
+== New Features ==
+- New braille tables: Arabic 8 dot computer braille, Arabic grade 2, Spanish grade 2. (#4435)
+- Added an option to NVDA's mouse settings to make NVDA handle situations where the mouse is controlled by another application. (#8452) 
+ - This will allow NVDA to track the mouse when a system is controlled remotely using TeamViewer or other remote control software.
+- Added the `--disable-start-on-logon` command line parameter to allow silent installations of NVDA that don't run at the logon screen by default. (#8574)
+- It is possible to turn NVDA's logging features off by setting logging level to "disabled" from General settings panel. (#8516)
+- The presence of formulae in LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice spreadsheets is now reported. (#860)
+- In Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, browse mode now reports the selected item in list boxes and trees.
+ - This works in Firefox 66 and later.
+ - This does not work for certain list boxes (HTML select controls) in Chrome.
+- Added the Afrikaans braille table. (#9186)
+- Early support for apps such as Mozilla Firefox on computers with ARM64 (e.g. Qualcom Snapdragon) processors. (#9216)
+- A new Advanced Settings category has been added to NVDA's Settings dialog, including an option to try out NVDA's new support for Microsoft Word via the Microsoft UI Automation API. (#9200)
+- Added support for the graphical view in Windows Disk Management. (#1486)
+- Added support for Handy Tech Connect Braille and Basic Braille 84. (#9249)
+- Added an experimental option to the Browse Mode Settings panel that allows you to stop  the system focus from following the browse mode cursor. (#2039) Although this may not be suitable to turn off for  all websites, this may fix: 
+ - Rubber band effect: NVDA sporadically undoes the last browse mode keystroke by jumping to the previous location.
+ - Edit boxes steal system focus when arrowing down through them on some websites.
+ - Browse mode keystrokes are slow to respond.
+
+
+== Changes ==
+- Updated liblouis braille translator to version 3.8.0. (#9013)
+- Add-on authors now can enforce a minimum required NVDA version for their add-ons. Unsupported add-ons will not load or install. (#6275)
+- Add-on authors must now specify the last version of NVDA the add-on has been tested against. Users will be warned against installing or enabling untested add-ons. (#6275)
+- The move mouse to navigator object command is now available in Microsoft Word as well as for UIA controls, particularly Microsoft Edge. (#7916, #8371)
+- Reporting of text under the mouse has been improved within Microsoft Edge and other UIA applications. (#8370)
+- When NVDA is started with the `--portable-path` command line parameter, the provided path is automatically filled in when trying to create a portable copy of NVDA using the NVDA menu. (#8623)
+- Updated the path to the Norwegian braille table to reflect the standard from the year 2015. (#9170)
+- When navigating by paragraph (control+arrows) or navigating by table cell (control+alt+arrows), the existence of spelling errors will no longer be announced, even if NVDA is configured to announce these automatically. This is because paragraphs and table cells can be quite large, and calculating spelling errors in some applications can be very costly. (#9217)
+- NVDA no longer automatically loads custom appModules, globalPlugins and braille and synth drivers from the NVDA user configuration directory. This code should be instead packaged as an add-on with correct version information, ensuring that incompatible code is not run with current versions of NVDA. (#9238)
+ - For developers who need to test code as it is being developed,  enable NVDA's developer scratchpad directory in the Advanced category of NVDA settings, and place your code in the 'scratchpad' directory found in the NVDA user configuration directory when this option is enabled.
+
+
+== Bug Fixes ==
+- OneCore speech synthesizer: On Windows 10 April 2018 and above, large chunks of silence are no longer inserted between speech utterances. (#8985)
+- When moving by character in plain text controls (such as Notepad) or browse mode, 32 bit emoji characters consisting of two UTF-16 code points (such as ðŸ¤¦) will now read properly. (#8782)
+- Improved restart confirmation dialog after changing interface language. The text and the button labels are now more concise and less confusing. (#6416)
+- If a 3rd party speech synthesizer fails to load, NVDA will fall back to Windows OneCore speech on Windows 10, rather than espeak. (#9025)
+- Removed the "Welcome Dialog" entry in the NVDA menu while on secure screens. (#8520)
+- When tabbing or using quick navigation in browse mode, legends on tab panels are now reported more consistently. (#709)
+- NVDA will now announce selection changes for certain time pickers such as in the Alarms and Clock app. (#5231)
+- In Windows 10's Action Center, NVDA will announce status messages when toggling quick actions such as brightness and focus assist. (#8954)
+- In action Center in Windows 10 October 2018 Update and earlier, NVDA will recognize brightness quick action control as a button instead of a toggle button. (#8845)
+- NVDA will again track cursor and announce deleted characters in the Microsoft Excel  go to and find edit fields. (#9042)
+- Fixed a rare browse mode crash in Firefox. (#9152)
+- NVDA no longer fails to report the focus for some controls in the Microsoft Office 2016 ribbon when collapsed.
+- NVDA no longer fails to report the suggested contact when entering addresses in new messages in Outlook 2016. (#8502)
+- The last few cursor routing keys on 80 cell eurobraille displays no longer route the cursor to a position at or just after the start of the braille line. (#9160)
+- Fixed table navigation in threaded view in Mozilla Thunderbird. (#8396)
+- In Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, switching to focus mode now works correctly for certain list boxes and trees (where the list box/tree is not itself focusable but its items are) . (#3573, #9157)
+- Browse mode is now correctly turned on by default when reading messages in Outlook 2016/365 if using NVDA's experimental UI Automation support for Word Documents. (#9188)
+- NVDA is now less likely to freeze in such a way that the only way to escape is signing out from your current windows session. (#6291)
+- In Windows 10 October 2018 Update and later, when opening cloud clipboard history with clipboard empty, NVDA will announce clipboard status. (#9112)
+- In Windows 10 October 2018 Update and later, when searching for emojis in emoji panel, NVDA will announce top search result. (#9112)
+- NVDA no longer freezes in the mainwindow of Virtualbox 5.2 and above. (#9202)
+- Responsiveness in Microsoft Word when navigating by line, paragraph or table cell may be significantly improved in some documents. A reminder that for best performance, set Microsoft Word to Draft view with alt+w,e after opening a document. (#9217) 
+- In Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, empty alerts are no longer reported. (#5657)
+- Significant performance improvements when navigating cells in Microsoft Excel, particularly when the spreadsheet contains comments and or validation dropdown lists. (#7348)
+- It should be no longer necessary to turn off in-cell editing in Microsoft Excel's options to access the cell edit control with NVDA in Excel 2016/365. (#8146).
+ 
+
+== Changes for Developers ==
+- NVDA can now  be built with all editions of Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (not just the Community edition). (#8939)
+- You can now include log output from liblouis into the NVDA log by setting the louis boolean flag in the debugLogging section of the NVDA configuration. (#4554)
+- Add-on authors are now able to provide NVDA version compatibility information in add-on manifests. (#6275, #9055)
+ - minimumNVDAVersion: The minimum required version of NVDA for an add-on to work properly.
+ - lastTestedNVDAVersion: The last version of NVDA an add-on has been tested with.
+- OffsetsTextInfo objects can now implement the _getBoundingRectFromOffset method to allow retrieval of bounding rectangles per characters instead of points. (#8572)
+- Added a boundingRect property to TextInfo objects to retrieve the bounding rectangle of a range of text. (#8371)
+- Properties and methods within classes can now be marked as abstract in NVDA. These classes will raise an error if instantiated. (#8294, #8652, #8658)
+- NVDA can log the time since input when text is spoken, which helps in measuring perceived responsiveness. This can be enabled by setting the timeSinceInput setting to True in the debugLog section of the NVDA configuration. (#9167)
