+Enabled by default, this option allows you to choose if the system focus should automatically be set to elements that can take the system focus (links, form fields, etc.) when navigating content with the browse mode caret.
+If enabled, this represents default behavior of NVDA as of version 2019.1 and before.
+Disabling this option will not automatically focus focusable elements when they are selected with the browse mode caret.
+This might result in faster browsing experience and better responsiveness in browse mode.
+The focus will yet be updated to the particular element when interacting with it (e.g. pressing a button, checking a check box).
+This functionality is experimental as of NVDA 2019.2.
