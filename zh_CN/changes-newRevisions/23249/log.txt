    Recover safely if the add-on store cache is invalid (#16461)
    
    Fixes #16362
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When cache files of the add-on store contain invalid data, NVDA is restarted.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None
    
    Description of development approach
    In the _getCachedAddonData function of the _DataManager class, a cachedAddonDatavariable will try to get the value of the _createStoreCollectionFromJson(data)`.
    So, if data doesn't match that model, the same exception of other invalid required values will be raised, and NVDA won't be restarted.
