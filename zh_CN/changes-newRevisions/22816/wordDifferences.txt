Please refer to the [NVDA docs https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/blob/release-2024.1/projectDocs/dev/createDevEnvironment.md] for the specific list of Visual Studio components. (#14313)
- Added the following extension points:



  - ``treeInterceptorHandler.post_browseModeStateChange``. (#14969, @nvdaes)
  - ``speech.speechCanceled``. (#15700, @LeonarddeR)

- It is now possible to use plural forms in an add-on's translations. (#15661, @beqabeqa473)
- Included python3.dll in the binary distribution for use by add-ons with external libraries utilizing the [stable ABI https://docs.python.org/3.11/c-api/stable.html]. (#15674, @mzanm)
- The ``BrailleDisplayDriver`` base class now has ``numRows`` and ``numCols`` properties to provide information about multi line braille displays.
Setting ``numCells`` is still supported for single line braille displays and ``numCells`` will return the total number of cells for multi line braille displays. (#15386)
- Updated BrlAPI for BRLTTY to version 0.8.5, and its corresponding python module to a Python 3.11 compatible build. (#15652, @LeonarddeR)







- Added the ``speech.speakSsml`` function, which allows you to write NVDA speech sequences using [SSML https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis11/]. (#15699, @LeonarddeR)
  - The following tags are currently supported and translated to appropriate NVDA speech commands:
    - ``Prosody`` (``pitch``, ``rate`` and ``volume``). Only multiplication (e.g. ``200%`` are supported.
    - ``say-as`` with the ``interpret`` attribute set to ``characters``
    - ``voice`` with the ``xml:lang`` set to an XML language
    - ``break`` with the ``time`` attribute set to a value in milliseconds, e.g. ``200ms``
    - ``mark`` with the ``name`` attribute set to a mark name, e.g. ``mark1``, requires providing a callback
    -
  - Example: ``speech.speakSsml('<speak><prosody pitch="200%">hello</prosody><break time="500ms" /><prosody rate="50%">John</prosody></speak>')``
  - The SSML parsing capabilities are backed by the ``SsmlParser`` class in the ``speechXml`` module.

- Changes to the NVDA Controller Client library:








  - The file names of the library no longer contain a suffix denoting the architecture, i.e. ``nvdaControllerClient32/64.dll`` are now called ``nvdaControllerClient.dll``. (#15718, #15717, @LeonarddeR)
  - Added an example to demonstrate using nvdaControllerClient.dll from Rust. (#15771, @LeonarddeR)
  - Added the following functions to the controller client: (#15734, #11028, #5638, @LeonarddeR)
    - ``nvdaController_getProcessId``: To get the process id (PID) of the current instance of NVDA the controller client is using.
    - ``nvdaController_speakSsml``: To instruct NVDA to speak according to the given SSML. This function also supports:
      - Providing the symbol level.
      - Providing the priority of speech to be spoken.
      - Speaking both synchronously (blocking) and asynchronously (instant return).
      -
    - ``nvdaController_setOnSsmlMarkReachedCallback``: To register a callback of type ``onSsmlMarkReachedFuncType`` that is called in synchronous mode for every ``<mark />`` tag encountered in the SSML sequence provided to ``nvdaController_speakSsml``.
    -

  - Note: the new functions in the controller client only support NVDA 2024.1 and above.
