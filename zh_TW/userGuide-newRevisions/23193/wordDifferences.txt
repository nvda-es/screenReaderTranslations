You can jump to the next or previous text paragraph by pressing ``p`` or ``shift+p``.
Text paragraphs are defined by a group of text that appears to be written in complete sentences.
This can be useful to find the beginning of readable content on various webpages, such as:
- News websites
- Forums
- Blog posts
- 

These commands can also be helpful for skipping certain kinds of clutter, such as:
- Ads
- Menus
- Headers
- 

Please note, however, that while NVDA tries its best to identify text paragraphs, the algorithm is not perfect and at times can make mistakes.
Additionally, this command is different from paragraph navigation commands ``control+downArrow/upArrow``.
Text paragraph navigation only jumps between text paragraphs, while paragraph navigation commands take the cursor to the previous/next paragraphs regardless of whether they contain text or not.

+++}+ Other navigation commands +++[OtherNavigationCommands]

In addition to the quick navigation commands listed above, NVDA has commands that have no default keys assigned.
To use these commands, you first need to assign gestures to them using the [Input Gestures dialog #InputGestures].
Here is a list of available commands:
- Article
- +{Figure

- Tab
- +{Menu item
- Toggle button
- Progress bar
- Math formula

- Same style text
- Different style text

This option is not available if you have started NVDA with [WASAPI disabled for audio output #WASAPI] in Advanced Settings.

+{==== Time to keep audio device awake after speech ====[AudioAwakeTime]

This edit box specifies how long NVDA keeps the audio device awake after speech ends.
This allows NVDA to avoid certain speech glitches like dropped parts of words.
This can happen due to audio devices (especially Bluetooth and wireless devices) entering standby mode.
This might also be helpful in other use cases, such as when running NVDA inside a virtual machine (e.g. Citrix Virtual Desktop), or on certain laptops.

Lower values may allow audio to be cut-off more often, as a device may enter standby mode too soon, causing the start of the following speech to be clipped.
Setting the value too high may cause the battery of the sound output device to discharge faster, as it stays active for longer while no sound is being sent.


You can set the time to zero in order to disable this feature.

==== Sound split====[SelectSoundSplitMode]

The sound split feature allows users to make use of their stereo output devices, such as headphones and speakers.
Sound split makes it possible to have NVDA speech in one channel (e.g. left) and have all other applications play their sounds in the other channel (e.g. right).
By default sound split is disabled, which means that all applications including NVDA will play sounds in both left and right channels.
A gesture allows cycling through the various sound split modes:
%kc:beginInclude
|| Name | Key | Description |
| Cycle Sound Split Mode | ``NVDA+alt+s`` | Cycles between sound split modes. |

%kc:endInclude

By default this command will cycle between the following modes:
- Disabled sound split: both NVDA and other applications output sounds to both left and right channels.
- NVDA on the left and applications on the right: NVDA will speak in the left channel, while other applications will play sounds in the right channel.
- NVDA on the right and applications on the left: NVDA will speak in the right channel, while other applications will play sounds in the left channel.
-

There are more advanced sound split modes available in NVDA setting combo box.
If you wish to adjust volume of all applications except for NVDA, consider using [the dedicated commands #OtherAppVolume].
Please note, that sound split doesn't work as a mixer.
For example, if an application is playing a stereo sound track while sound split is set to "NVDA on the left and applications on the right", then you will only hear the right channel of the sound track, while the left channel of the sound track will be muted.

This option is not available if you have started NVDA with [WASAPI disabled for audio output #WASAPI] in Advanced Settings.

Please note, that if NVDA crashes, then it won't be able to restore application sounds volume, and those applications might still output sound only in one channel after NVDA crash.
In order to mitigate this, please restart NVDA.

==== Customizing Sound split modes====[CustomizeSoundSplitModes]
This checkable list allows selecting which sound split modes are included when cycling between them using ``NVDA+alt+s``.
Modes which are unchecked are excluded.
By default only three modes are included.
- Sound split disabled: both NVDA and applications play sounds in both left and right channels.
- NVDA on the left and all other applications on the right channel.
- NVDA on the right and all other applications on the left channel.

Note that it is necessary to check at least one mode.
This option is not available if you have started NVDA with [WASAPI disabled for audio output #WASAPI] in Advanced Settings.

==== Volume of other applications ====[OtherAppVolume]

This slider allows you to adjust the volume of all currently running applications other than NVDA.
This volume setting will apply to all other applications sound output, even if they start after this setting is changed.
This volume can also be controlled via the following keyboard commands from anywhere:

%kc:beginInclude
|| Name | Key | Description |
| Increase applications volume | ``NVDA+alt+pageUp`` | Increases volume of all applications except NVDA. |
| Decrease applications volume | ``NVDA+alt+pageDown`` | Decreases volume of all applications except NVDA. |

This option is not available if you have started NVDA with [WASAPI disabled for audio output #WASAPI] in Advanced Settings.

==== Mute other applications ====[MuteApplications]

| Toggle mute other applications | ``NVDA+alt+delete`` | Mutes or unmutes all applications other than NVDA. |
