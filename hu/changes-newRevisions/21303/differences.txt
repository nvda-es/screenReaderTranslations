+== Bug Fixes ==
+- When updating NVDA using the Windows Package Manager CLI (aka winget), a released version of NVDA is no longer always treated as newer than whatever alpha version is installed. (#12469)
+- NVDA will now correctly announce Group boxes in Java applications. (#13962)
+- Caret properly follows spoken text during "say all" in applications such as Bookworm, WordPad, or the NVDA log viewer. (#13420, #9179)
+- In programs using UI Automation, partially checked checkboxes will be reported correctly. (#13975)
+- Improved performance and stability in Microsoft Visual Studio, Windows Terminal, and other UI Automation based applications. (#11077, #11209)
+  - These fixes apply to Windows 11 Sun Valley 2 (version 22H2) and later.
+  - Selective registration for UI Automation events and property changes now enabled by default.
+  -
+- Text reporting, Braille output, and password suppression now work as expected in the embedded Windows Terminal control in Visual Studio 2022. (#14194)
+- NVDA is now DPI aware when using multiple monitors.
+There are several fixes for using a DPI setting higher than 100% or multiple monitors.
+Issues may still exist with versions of Windows older than Windows 10 1809.
+For these fixes to work, applications which NVDA interacts with also need to be DPI aware.
+Note there are still known issues with Chrome and Edge. (#13254)
+  - Visual highlighting frames should now be correctly placed in most applications. (#13370, #3875, #12070)
+  - Touch screen interaction should now be accurate for most applications. (#7083)
+  - Mouse tracking should now work for most applications. (#6722)
+  -
+- Orientation state (landscape/portrait) changes are now correctly ignored when there is no change (e.g. monitor changes). (#14035)
+- NVDA will announce dragging items on screen in places such as rearranging Windows 10 Start menu tiles and virtual desktops in Windows 11. (#12271, #14081)
+- In advanced settings, "Play a sound for logged errors" option is now correctly restored to its default value when pressing the "Restore defaults" button. (#14149)
+- NVDA can now select text using the ``NVDA+f10`` keyboard shortcut on Java applications. (#14163)

+
+== Changes for Developers ==

+
+- The [NVDA API Announcement mailing list https://groups.google.com/a/nvaccess.org/g/nvda-api/about] was created. (#13999)
+- NVDA no longer processes ``textChange`` events for most UI Automation applications due to their extreme negative performance impact. (#11002, #14067)
+-
+
