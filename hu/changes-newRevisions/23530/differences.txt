 # What's New in NVDA
 
+## 2024.3
+The Add-on Store will now notify you if any add-on updates are available on NVDA start up.
+
+This release adds support for Unicode Normalization to speech and braille output.
+This can be useful when reading characters that are unknown to a particular speech synthesizer or braille table and which have a compatible alternative, like the bold and italic characters commonly used on social media.
+It also allows reading of equations in the Microsoft Word equation editor.
+
+There are several bug fixes, particularly for the Windows 11 Emoji Panel and Clipboard history.
+For web browsers, there are fixes for reporting error messages, figures, captions, table labels and checkbox/radio button menu items.
+
+Liblouis has been updated, adding new Braille tables for Cyrillic Serbian, Yiddish, several ancient languages (Biblical Hebrew, Akkadian, Syriac, and Ugaritic), and transliterated Cuneiform text.
+eSpeak has been updated, adding support for the Karakalpak language.
+Unicode CLDR has also been updated.
+
+

+### Changes for Developers
+
+Please refer to [the developer guide](https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/developerGuide.html#API) for information on NVDA's API deprecation and removal process.
+
+* Fixed NVDA's build system to work properly when using Visual Studio 2022 version 17.10 and above. (#16480, @LeonarddeR)
+* A fixed width font is now used in Log Viewer and in the NVDA Python Console so that the cursor remains in the same column during vertical navigation.
+It is especially useful to read the error location markers in tracebacks. (#16321,  @CyrilleB79)
+* Support for custom braille tables has been added. (#3304, #16208, @JulienCochuyt, @LeonarddeR)
+  * Tables can be provided in the `brailleTables` folder in an add-on package.
+  * Table metadata can be added to an optional `brailleTables` section in the add-on manifest or to a `.ini` file with the same format found in the brailleTables subdirectory of the scratchpad directory.
+  * Please consult the [braille translation tables section in the developer guide](https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/developerGuide.html#BrailleTables) for more details.
+* When a `gainFocus` event is queued with an object that has a valid `focusRedirect` property, the object pointed to by the `focusRedirect` property is now held by `eventHandler.lastQueuedFocusObject`, rather than the originally queued object. (#15843)
+* NVDA will log its executable architecture (x86) at startup. (#16432, @josephsl)
+* `wx.CallAfter`, which is wrapped in `monkeyPatches/wxMonkeyPatches.py`, now includes proper `functools.wraps` indication. (#16520, @XLTechie)
+* There is a new module for scheduling tasks `utils.schedule`, using the pip module `schedule`. (#16636)
+  * You can use `scheduleThread.scheduleDailyJobAtStartUp` to automatically schedule a job that happens after NVDA starts, and every 24 hours after that.
+  Jobs are scheduled with a delay to avoid conflicts.
+  * `scheduleThread.scheduleDailyJob` and `scheduleJob` can be used to schedule jobs at custom times, where a `JobClashError` will be raised on a known job scheduling clash.
+* It is now possible to create app modules for apps hosting Edge WebView2 (msedgewebview2.exe) controls. (#16705, @josephsl)
