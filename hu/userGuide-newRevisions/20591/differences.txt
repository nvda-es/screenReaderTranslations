+This option allows you to specify whether browse mode should place clickable content (links, buttons and fields) on its own line, or if it should keep it in the flow of text as it is visually shown. Note that this option doesn't apply to Microsoft Office apps such as Outlook and Word, which always use screen layout.
+When screen layout is enabled, page elements will stay as they are visually shown. For example, a visual line of multiple links will be presented in speech and braille as multiple links on the same line. If it is disabled, then page elements will be placed on their own lines, which may be easier to understand during line by line page navigation, and may make items easier to interact with for some users.

-==== Use UI automation to access Microsoft Word document controls when available ====[AdvancedSettingsUseUiaForWord]
-When this option is enabled, NVDA will try to use the Microsoft UI Automation accessibility API in order to fetch information from Microsoft Word document controls.
-This includes Microsoft Word itself, and also the Microsoft Outlook message viewer and composer.
- For the most recent versions of Microsoft Office 2016/365 running on Windows 10 and later, UI Automation support is complete enough to provide access to Microsoft Word documents almost equal to NVDA's existing Microsoft Word support, with the added advantage that responsiveness is majorly increased.
-However, There may be some information which is either not exposed, or exposed incorrectly in some versions of Microsoft Office, which means this UI automation support cannot always be relied upon.
-We still do not recommend that  the majority of users turn this on by default, though we do welcome users of Office 2016/365 to test this feature and provide feedback.

 ==== Use UI Automation to access the Windows Console when available ====[AdvancedSettingsConsoleUIA]
 When this option is enabled, NVDA will use a new, work in progress version of its support for Windows Console which takes advantage of [accessibility improvements made by Microsoft https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/whats-new-in-windows-console-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update/]. This feature is highly experimental and is still incomplete, so its use is not yet recommended. However, once completed, it is anticipated that this new support will become the default, improving NVDA's performance and stability in Windows command consoles.
