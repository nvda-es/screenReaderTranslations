+For example, if you move to the next object in this flattened view and the current object contains other objects, NVDA will automatically move to the first object that it contains.
 Alternatively, if the current object doesn't contain any objects, NVDA will move to the next object at the current level of the hierarchy.
 If there is no such next object, NVDA will try to find the next object in the hierarchy based on containing objects until there are no more objects to move to.
 The same rules apply to moving backwards in the hierarchy.
