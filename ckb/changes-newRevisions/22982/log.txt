    No longer report "native copy" when copying text in native selection mode in browse mode (#16262)
    
    Related to #16202 and #16201.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In NVDA's new native selection mode in browse mode for Firefox, and MS word / Outlook browse mode, when native copying to clipboard with control+c, NVDA would report "native copy". this message has proven confusing and or unpopular. Thus this pr removes the message.
    therefore, now when copying text with control+c when native seleciton mode is turned on, in Firefox / MS word / Outlook browse mode, NVDA will not say anything at all, and just let the application react the way it normally would (E.g. MS word may announce "copy" via its UIA notification).
    
    Description of user facing changes
    NVDA will no longer announce "native copy" when copying text with native selection mode.
    
    Description of development approach
    the "native copy" message has been removed from the clipyToclipboard script in cursorManager.
    MS word's own "copy" UIA notification message is no longer suppressed in browse mode.
