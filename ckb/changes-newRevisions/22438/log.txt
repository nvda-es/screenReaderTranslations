    Force incompatibility for NVDAExtensionGlobalPlugin versions 12.0.8 or below (#15443)
    
    Follow-up of #15402
    
    See #15402 (comment)
    
    Summary of the issue:
    As with Tony's Enhancements add-on, "NVDA global commands extension" add-on (name = NVDAExtensionGlobalPlugin) version 12.0.8 or below causes speech muted with WASAPI, so with NVDA 2023.3beta1.
    
    This add-on is not in NVDA store but is popular in French community as well as in international community; it is translated in 10 languages.
    
    A fix release (13.0) has already been created by the author @paulber19 on August 20. But we cannot ensure that people will have updated before updating NVDA.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    No problem when running NVDA with NVDAExtensionGlobalPlugin 12.0.8: NVDA is speaking.
    
    Description of development approach
    Added this add-on and its version in the list to force incompatibility.
