However, There may be some information which is either not exposed, or exposed incorrectly in some versions of Microsoft Office, which means this UI automation support cannot always be relied upon.
We still do not recommend that  the majority of users turn this on by default, though we do welcome users of Office 2016/365 to test this feature and provide feedback.

==== Use the new typed character support in -{legacy}- Windows -{consoles}- +{Console}+ when available ====[AdvancedSettingsKeyboardSupportInLegacy]
This option enables an alternative method for detecting typed characters in -{legacy}- Windows +{command}+ consoles.
While it improves performance and prevents some console output from being spelled out, it may be incompatible with some terminal programs.
This feature is available and enabled by default on Windows 10 versions 1607, 1703, 1709 and 1803 as well as on newer Windows 10 releases when UI Automation is unavailable or disabled.
Warning: with this option enabled, typed characters that do not appear onscreen, such as passwords, will not be suppressed.
