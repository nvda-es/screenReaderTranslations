+In situations where UI Automation is unavailable or known to result in an inferior user experience, NVDA's legacy console support is available as a fallback.
+The Windows Console support combo box has three options:
+- Automatic: Uses UI Automation in the version of Windows Console included with Windows 11 version 22H2 and later.
+This option is recommended and set by default.
+- UIA when available: Uses UI Automation in consoles if available, even for versions with incomplete or buggy implementations.
+While this limited functionality may be useful (and even sufficient for your usage), use of this option is entirely at your own risk and no support for it will be provided.
+- Legacy: UI Automation in the Windows Console will be completely disabled.
+The legacy fallback will always be used even in situations where UI Automation would provide a superior user experience.
