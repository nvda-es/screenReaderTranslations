 Enabled by default, this option allows you to choose if gestures (such as key presses) that  do not result in an NVDA command and are not considered to be a command key in general, should be trapped from going through to the document you are currently focused on. 
 As an example, if enabled, if the letter j was pressed, it would be trapped from reaching the document, even though it is not a quick navigation command nor is it likely to be a command in the application itself.

-Enabled by default, this option allows you to choose if system focus automatically follows browse mode focus in browsers.
-If enabled, this represents default behavior of NVDA as of version 2018.4 and before.
-Disabling this option might result in faster browsing experience and better responsiveness in browse mode. This is experimental as of version 2019.1.

+==== Enable loading custom code from Developer Scratchpad Directory ====[AdvancedSettingsEnableScratchpad]
 When developing add-ons for NVDA, it is useful to be able to test code as you are writing it.
 This option when enabled, allows NVDA to load custom appModules, globalPlugins, brailleDisplayDrivers and synthDrivers, from a special developer scratchpad directory in your NVDA user configuration directory.
 Previously NVDA would load custom code directly from the user configuration directory, with no way of disabling this.
 This option is off by default, ensuring that no untested code is ever run in NVDA with out the user's explicit knowledge.
 If you wish to distribute custom code to others, you should package it as an NVDA add-on.

+==== Use UI automation to access Microsoft Word document controls when available ====[AdvancedSettingsUseUiaForWord]
 When this option is enabled, NVDA will try to use  the Microsoft UI Automation accessibility api in order to fetch information from Microsoft Word document controls.
 This includes in Microsoft Word itself, and also the Microsoft Outlook message viewer and composer.
  For the most recent versions of Microsoft Office 2016/365 running on windows 10, UI Automation support is complete enough to provide access to Microsoft Word documents almost equal to NVDA's existing Microsoft Word support, with the added advantage that responsiveness is majorly increased.
 However, There may be some information which is either not exposed, or exposed incorrectly in some versions of Microsoft Office, which means this UI automation support cannot always be relied upon.
 We still do not recommend that  the majority of users turn this on by default, though we do welcome users of Office 2016/365 to test this feature and provide feedback.

+This option allows you to configure the number of milliseconds NVDA will wait for the caret (insertion point) to move in editable text controls.
 If you find that NVDA seems to be incorrectly tracking the caret E.g. it seems to be always one character behind or is repeating lines, then you may wish to try increasing this value.
 
-==== Debug logging categories ====
+==== Debug logging categories ====[AdvancedSettingsDebugLoggingCategories]
 The checkboxes in this list allow you to enable specific categories of debug messages in NVDA's log.
 Logging these messages can resort in decreased performance and large log files.
 Only turn one of these on if specifically instructed to by an NVDA developer e.g. when debugging why a braille display driver is not functioning correctly.
