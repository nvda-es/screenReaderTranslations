 == Important notes ==
-- Screen Curtain on previous releases of NVDA is no longer compatible with versions of Windows newer than Windows 10 21H2 (10.0.19044).

+Use NVDA 2021.2 to activate Screen Curtain with Windows 10 21H2 (10.0.19044) or later.
 This includes Windows 10 Insiders and Windows 11.
