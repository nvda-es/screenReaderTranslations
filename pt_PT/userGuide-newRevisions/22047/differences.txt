++ Add-ons and the Add-on Store +[AddonsManager]
+Add-ons are software packages which provide new or altered functionality for NVDA.
+They are developed by the NVDA community, and external organisations such as commercial vendors.
+Add-ons may do any of the following:
+- Add or enhance support for certain applications.
+- Provide support for extra Braille displays or speech synthesizers.
+- Add or change features in NVDA.
+-
+
+NVDA's Add-on Store allows you to browse and manage add-on packages.
+All add-ons that are available in the Add-on Store can be downloaded for free.
+However, some of them may require users to pay for a license or additional software before they can be used.
+Commercial speech synthesizers are an example of this type of add-on.
+If you install an add-on with paid components and change your mind about using it, the add-on can be easily removed.
+
+The Add-on Store is accessed from the Tools submenu of the NVDA menu.
+To access the Add-on Store from anywhere, assign a custom gesture using the [Input Gestures dialog #InputGestures].
+
+++ Browsing add-ons ++[AddonStoreBrowsing]
+When opened, the Add-on Store displays a list of add-ons.
+You can jump back to the list with ``alt+l`` from anywhere else within the store.
+If you have not installed an add-on before, the add-on store will open to a list of add-ons available to install.
+If you have installed add-ons, the list will display currently installed add-ons.
+
+Selecting an add-on, by moving to it with the up and down arrow keys, will display the details for the add-on.
+Add-ons have associated actions that you can access through an [actions menu #AddonStoreActions], such as install, help, disable, and remove.
+Available actions will change based on whether the add-on is installed or not, and whether it is enabled or disabled.
+
++++ Add-on list views +++[AddonStoreFilterStatus]
+There are different views for installed, updatable, available and incompatible add-ons.
+To change the view of add-ons, change the active tab of the add-ons list using ``ctrl+tab``.
+You can also ``tab`` to the list of views, and move through them with the ``leftArrow`` and ``rightArrow`` keys.
+
++++ Filtering for enabled or disabled add-ons +++[AddonStoreFilterEnabled]
+Normally, an installed add-on is "enabled", meaning that it is running and available within NVDA.
+However, some of your installed add-ons may be set to the "disabled" state.
+This means that they will not be used, and their functions won't be available during your current NVDA session.
+You may have disabled an add-on because it conflicted with another add-on, or with a certain application.
+NVDA may also disable certain add-ons, if they are found to be incompatible during an NVDA upgrade; though you will be warned if this is going to happen.
+Add-ons can also be disabled if you simply don't need them for a prolonged period, but don't want to uninstall them because you expect to want them again in the future.
+
+The lists of installed and incompatible add-ons can be filtered by their enabled or disabled state.
+The default shows both enabled and disabled add-ons.
+
++++ Include incompatible add-ons +++[AddonStoreFilterIncompatible]
+Available and updatable add-ons can be filtered to include [incompatible add-ons #incompatibleAddonsManager] that are available to install.
+
++++ Filter add-ons by channel +++[AddonStoreFilterChannel]
+Add-ons can be distributed through up to four channels:
+- Stable: The developer has released this as a tested add-on with a released version of NVDA.
+- Beta: This add-on may need further testing, but is released for user feedback.
+Suggested for early adopters.
+- Dev: This channel is suggested to be used by add-on developers to test unreleased API changes.
+NVDA alpha testers may need to use a "Dev" version of their add-ons.
+- External: Add-ons installed from external sources, outside of the add-on store.
+-
+
+To list add-ons only for specific channels, change the "Channel" filter selection.
+
++++ Searching for add-ons +++[AddonStoreFilterSearch]
+To search add-ons, use the "Search" text box.
+You can reach it by pressing ``shift+tab`` from the list of add-ons, or by pressing ``alt+s`` from anywhere in the Add-on Store interface.
+Type a keyword or two for the kind of add-on you're looking for, then ``tab`` back to the list of add-ons.
+Add-ons will be listed if the search text can be found in the display name, publisher or description.
+
+++ Add-on actions ++[AddonStoreActions]
+Add-ons have associated actions, such as install, help, disable, and remove.
+The actions menu can be accessed for an add-on in the add-on list by pressing the ``applications`` key, ``enter``, right clicking or double clicking the add-on.
+There is also an Actions button in the selected add-on's details, which can be activated normally or by pressing ``alt+a``.
+
++++ Installing add-ons +++[AddonStoreInstalling]
+Just because an add-on is available in the NVDA Add-ons Store, does not mean that it has been approved or vetted by NV Access or anyone else.
+It is very important to only install add-ons from sources you trust.
+The functionality of add-ons is unrestricted inside NVDA. 
+This could include accessing your personal data or even the entire system.
+
+You can install and update add-ons by [browsing Available add-ons #AddonStoreBrowsing].
+Select an add-on from the "Available add-ons" or "Updatable add-ons" tab.
+Then use the update, install, or replace action to start the installation.
+
+To install an add-on you have obtained outside of the Add-on Store, press the "Install from external source" button.
+This will allow you to browse for an add-on package (``.nvda-addon`` file) somewhere on your computer or on a network.
+Once you open the add-on package, the installation process will begin.
+
+If NVDA is installed and running on your system, you can also open an add-on file directly from the browser or file system to begin the installation process.
+
+When an add-on is being installed from an external source, NVDA will ask you to confirm the installation.
+Once the add-on is installed, NVDA must be restarted for the add-on to start running, although you may postpone restarting NVDA if you have other add-ons to install or update.
+
++++ Removing Add-ons +++[AddonStoreRemoving]
+To remove an add-on, select the add-on from the list and use the Remove action.
+NVDA will ask you to confirm removal.
+As with installing, NVDA must be restarted for the add-on to be fully removed.
+Until you do, a status of "Pending removal" will be shown for that add-on in the list.
+
++++ Disabling and Enabling Add-ons +++[AddonStoreDisablingEnabling]
+To disable an add-on, use the "disable" action.
+To enable a previously disabled add-on, use the "enable" action.
+You can disable an add-on if the add-on status indicates it is  "enabled", or enable it if the add-on is "disabled".
+For each use of the enable/disable action, add-on status changes to indicate what will happen when NVDA restarts.
+If the add-on was previously "disabled", the status will show "enabled after restart".
+If the add-on was previously "enabled", the status will show "disabled after restart".
+Just like when you install or remove add-ons, you need to restart NVDA in order for changes to take effect.
+
+++ Incompatible Add-ons ++[incompatibleAddonsManager]
+Some older add-ons may no longer be compatible with the version of NVDA that you have.
+If you are using an older version of NVDA, some newer add-ons may not be compatible either.
+Attempting to install an incompatible add-on will result in an error explaining why the add-on is considered incompatible.
+
+For older add-ons, you can override the incompatibility at your own risk.
+Incompatible add-ons may not work with your version of NVDA, and can cause unstable or unexpected behaviour including crashing.
+You can override compatibility when enabling or installing an add-on.
+If the incompatible add-on causes issues later, you can disable or remove it.
+
+If you are having trouble running NVDA, and you have recently updated or installed an add-on, especially if it is an incompatible add-on, you may want to try running NVDA temporarily with all add-ons disabled.
+To restart NVDA with all add-ons disabled, choose the appropriate option when quitting NVDA.
+Alternatively, use the [command line option #CommandLineOptions] ``--disable-addons``.
+
+You can browse available incompatible add-ons using the [available and updatable add-ons tabs #AddonStoreFilterStatus].
+You can browse installed incompatible add-ons using the [incompatible add-ons tab #AddonStoreFilterStatus].
