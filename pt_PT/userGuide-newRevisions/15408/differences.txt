+==== Trust voice's language when processing characters and symbols ====[SpeechSettingsTrust]
 On by default, this option tells NVDA if the current voice's language can be trusted when processing symbols and characters.
 If you find that NVDA is reading punctuation in the wrong language for a particular synthesizer or voice, you may wish to turn this off to force NVDA to use its global language setting instead.
 
+==== Include Unicode Consortium data (including emoji) when processing characters and symbols ====[SpeechSettingsCLDR]
+When this checkbox is enabled, NVDA will include additional symbol pronunciation dictionaries when pronouncing characters and symbols.
+These dictionaries contain descriptions for symbols (particularly emoji) that are provided by the [Unicode Consortium http://www.unicode.org/consortium/] as part of their [Common Locale Data Repository http://cldr.unicode.org/].
+If you want NVDA to speak descriptions of emoji characters based on this data, you should enable this option.
+However, if you are using a speech synthesizer that supports speaking emoji descriptions natively, you may wish to turn this off.
+
+Note that manually added or edited character descriptions are saved as part of your user settings.
+Therefore, if you change the description of a particular emoji, your custom description will be spoken for that emoji regardless of whether this option is enabled.
+You can add, edit or remove symbol descriptions in NVDA's [punctuation/symbol pronunciation dialog #SymbolPronunciation].
