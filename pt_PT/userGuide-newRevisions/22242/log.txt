    User Guide fixes (#15256)
    
    Fix-up of #15065
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Various issues found in documentation while reviewing translation:
    
    Flattened review:
    For example, if you move to the next object in this flattened view and the current object contains other objects, NVDA will automatically move to the first object that contains it.
    Should be "that it contains", not "that contains it"!
    Cc @leonardder for approval
    
    Excel UIA option not at the correct place in the documentation with respect to its position in the GUI's Advanced settings panel.
    
    Searching for add-ons
    
    -Type a keyword or two for the kind of add-on you're looking for, then tab back to the list of add-ons.
    Actually, we tab forward, not back.
    
    Add-on Store spelling: Let's take care to use an unique writing so that people get immediately used:
    So "Add-on Store", not "Add-ons Store".
    
    Key name formatting:
    Key name formatting should always be used for single keys, not for a whole list of keys including separators or parenthesis that do not belong to the name of a key as done for some braille keys.
