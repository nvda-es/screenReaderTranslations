    Initialize MathPlayer when NVDA starts (#13486)
    
    Fixes #13463
    
    Summary of the issue:
    mathPres.ensureInit is called whenever math content is expected to be read, including from getTextWithFields.
    This is called with every read when using UIA with Word.
    If mathPlayer is not installed, this pollutes the log.
    Ideally, math should be initialized at NVDA startup time.
    
    Description of how this pull request fixes the issue:
    Makes mathPlayer initialize on start up.
    Removes mathPlayer.ensureInit usages from within NVDA.
    External documentation referencing mathPlayer may need to be updated to reflect the need to restart NVDA after installing mathPlayer.
