    Fixup of #13542: Do not call IA2 install and uninstall code from NVDA itself (#15517)
    
    Fixup of #13542
    
    Summary of the issue:
    In #13542, we introduced support for multi thread IA2 initialization. As part of that, the signature of the install- and uninstallIA2Support functions were changed. Somehow, it was an oversight from my end that these functions were also called from NVDAHelper.py. This causes:
    
    NVDA to always log a debug warning on exit, saying that it was unable to unregister IA2 support.
    NVDA to call installIA2Initialize without a thread Id. It is actually a miracle that the segfault we're now seeing in preliminary PY3.11 work didn't hurt us earlyer. That said, I think I've seen cases were NVDA played the startup sound and then silently crashed. I think this should be the case.
    As per point 2, given the risk of NVDA calling a code path that results in undefined behavior and possible segfaults, I strongly recommend to merge this into beta.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    No crashes during NVDA startup.
    
    Description of development approach
    Removed the calls from NVDAHelper.py and no longer export the functions from NVDAHelper. The calls in NVDA core were actually obsolete, as IA2 support is registered by injection_initialize and injection_terminate. Note that the install and uninstall IA2 functions aren't called in de 64 bit loader of NVDAHelper, yet IA2 works as expected in X64 applications. Also, installIA2Support is no longer C friendly anyway. Note that an add-on author should never call these functions, therefore I don't consider this as an API breaking change.
