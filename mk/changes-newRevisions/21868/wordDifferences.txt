== New Features ==
- Added pronunciation of Unicode symbols:
  - braille symbols such as "⠐⠣⠃⠗⠇⠐⠜". (#14548)
  - Mac Option key symbol "⌥". (#14682)
  -
- In Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, NVDA now reports when a control opens a dialog, grid, list or tree if the author has specified this using aria-haspopup. (#14709)
- 


== Changes ==
- Updated LibLouis braille translator to [3.25.0 https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases/tag/v3.25.0]. (#14719)
- Dash and em-dash symbols will always be sent to the synthesizer. (#13830)
- Distance reported in Microsoft Word will now honour the unit defined in Word's advanced options even when using UIA to access Word documents. (#14542)
- When reporting the review cursor location, the current cursor/caret location is now reported relative to the current page in LibreOffice Writer for LibreOffice versions >= 7.6, similar to what is done for Microsoft Word. (#11696)
- NVDA now responds slightly faster to commands and focus changes. (#14701)
- NVDA responds faster when moving the cursor in edit controls. (#14708)
- Baum Braille driver: addes several Braille chord gestures for performing common keyboard commands such as windows+d, alt+tab etc. Please refer to the NVDA user guide for a full list. (#14714)
- When using a Braille Display via the Standard HID braille driver, the dpad can be used to emulate the arrow keys and enter. Also space+dot1 and space+dot4 now map to up and down arrow respectively. (#14713)
- Script for reporting the destination of a link now reports from the caret / focus position rather than the navigator object. (#14659)
-


== Bug Fixes ==
- NVDA will no longer unnecessarily switch to no braille multiple times during auto detection, resulting in a cleaner log and less overhead. (#14524)
- NVDA will now switch back to USB if a HID Bluetooth device (such as the HumanWare Brailliant or APH Mantis) is automatically detected and an USB connection becomes available.
This only worked for Bluetooth Serial ports before. (#14524)
- It is now possible to use the backslash character in the replacement field of a dictionaries entry, when the type is not set to regular expression. (#14556)
- In Browse mode, NVDA will no longer incorrectly ignore focus moving to a parent or child control e.g. moving from a control to its parent list item or gridcell. (#14611)
  - Note however that this fix only applies when the Automatically set focus to focusable elements" option in Browse Mode settings is turned off (which is the default).
  -
- NVDA no longer occasionally causes Mozilla Firefox to crash or stop responding. (#14647)
- In Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, typed characters are no longer reported in some text boxes even when speak typed characters is disabled. (#14666)
- You can now use browse mode in Chromium Embedded Controls where it was not possible previously. (#13493, #8553)
- For symbols which do not have a symbol description in the current locale, the default English symbol level will be used. (#14558, #14417)
- In newer releases of Windows 11 Notepad, NVDA can once again announce status bar contents. (#14573)
- In Mozilla Firefox, moving the mouse over text after a link now reliably reports the text. (#9235)
- In Windows 10 and 11 Calculator, a portable copy of NVDA will no longer do nothing or play error tones when entering expressions in standard calculator in compact overlay mode. (#14679)
- When trying to report the URL for a link without a href attribute NVDA is no longer silent.
Instead NVDA reports that the link has no destination. (#14723)

== Changes for Developers ==
Please refer to [the developer guide https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/developerGuide.html#API] for information on NVDA's API deprecation and removal process.
- Added a new extension point type called ``Chain``, which can be used to iterate over iterables returned by registered handlers. (#14531)
- Added the ``bdDetect.scanForDevices`` extension point.
Handlers can be registered that yield ``BrailleDisplayDriver/DeviceMatch`` pairs that don't fit in existing categories, like USB or Bluetooth. (#14531)
- Added extension point: ``synthDriverHandler.synthChanged``. (#14618)
- The NVDA Synth Settings Ring now caches available setting values the first time they're needed, rather than when loading the synthesizer. (#14704)
- You can now call the export method on a gesture map to export it to a dictionary.
This dictionary can be imported in another gesture by passing it either to the constructor of ``GlobalGestureMap`` or to the update method on an existing map. (#14582)
