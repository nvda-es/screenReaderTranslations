    Summary of the issue:
    Change log contains an incorrect item
    Fixed performance issues with Task Manager and some Windows versions. (#6245)
    
    Indeed #6245. It had been erroneously closed as duplicate of #15519 before being reopened again. Indeed, #15519 is about tagging the task list as bad UIA window, whereas #6245 was already an issue before trying to consider the task list as good UIA window.
