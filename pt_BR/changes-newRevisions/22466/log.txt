    Fix bug where NVDA would not speak until restarted after add-on installation. (#15448)
    
    Fixes #14525
    
    Summary of the issue:
    NVDA blocks exit on modal dialogs which require an answer.
    If a message box is created after NVDA has triggered a shutdown, NVDA blocks exit on the message box, even after synthesizers have been terminated.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Fix bug where NVDA would not speak until restarted after add-on installation.
    Similar bugs with the same root cause may also be fixed.
    
    Description of development approach
    Open, pending modal dialogs should block the exit of NVDA.
    To prevent a deadlock NVDA should prevent opening new modal dialogs if the core shutdown has been triggered.
