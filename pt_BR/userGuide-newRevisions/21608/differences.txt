+: Default
+  Handled by application
+: Options
+  Default (Handled by application), Handled by application, Single line break, Multi line break
+:
+
+This combo box allows you to select the paragraph style to be used when navigating by paragraphs with ``control+upArrow`` and ``control+downArrow``.
+The available paragraph styles are:
+- Handled by application: NVDA will let the application determine the previous or next paragraph, and NVDA will read the new paragraph when navigating.
+This style works best when the application supports paragraph navigation natively, and is the default.
+- Single line break: NVDA will attempt to determine the previous or next paragraph using a single line break as the paragraph indicator.
+This style works best when reading documents in an application which does not natively support paragraph navigation, and paragraphs in the document are marked by a single press of the ``enter`` key.
+- Multi line break: NVDA will attempt to determine the previous or next paragraph using at least one blank line (two presses of the ``enter`` key) as the paragraph indicator.
+This style works best when working with documents which use block paragraphs.
+Note that this paragraph style cannot be used in Microsoft Word or Microsoft Outlook, unless you are using UIA to access Microsoft Word controls.

+==== Speak new text in Windows Terminal via ====[WtStrategy]
+: Default
+  Diffing
+: Options
+  Diffing, UIA notifications
+:
+
+This option selects how NVDA determines what text is "new" (and thus what to speak when "report dynamic content changes" is enabled) in Windows Terminal and the WPF Windows Terminal control used in Visual Studio 2022.
+It does not affect the Windows Console (``conhost.exe``).
+The Speak new text in Windows Terminal combo box has three options:
+- Default: This option is currently equivalent to "diffing", but it is anticipated to change once support for UIA notifications is further developed.
+- Diffing: This option uses the selected diff algorithm to calculate changes each time the terminal renders new text.
+This is identical to NVDA's behaviour in versions 2022.4 and earlier.
+- UIA notifications: This option defers the responsibility of determining what text to speak to Windows Terminal itself, meanning that NVDA no longer has to determine what text currently on-screen is "new".
+This should markedly improve performance and stability of Windows Terminal, but this feature is not yet complete.
+In particular, typed characters that are not displayed on-screen, such as passwords, are reported when this option is selected.
+Additionally, contiguous spans of output of over 1,000 characters may not be reported accurately.
