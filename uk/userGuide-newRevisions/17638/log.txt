    * Add class docstring.
    
    * Optimization: clear character buffers when reporting new lines.
    
    This saves us from scanning the old and new lines twice in _calculateNewText (once for diffing and once for finding nonblank indices), and fixes typed word reporting for 21H1 console.
    
    This new approach does not resolve #10942.
    
    * Update inaccurate information in user guide.
