    Revert "Improve shortcut key reporting (#14900)" (#15237)
    
    Fixes #15233
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Unfortunately pr #14900 causes Code Factory Eloquence to spell out menu items with shortcut keys, such as in the NVDA menu.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Menu items are no longer spelled out when focusing menu items when using the Code Factory Eloquence driver.
    
    Description of development approach
    Although the bug is technically in the Code Factory driver I think - not handlin character mode command correctly when embedded in other speech,
    PR 14900 is the first known case that exercises the bug directly.
    Because 2023.2 is not an add-on breaking release, we are reverting pr #14900.
    A replacement pr for 2023.3 can be opened that avoids affecting Code Factory Eloquence if at all possible, or a new copy of the reverted pr can be opened for NVDA 2024.1.
