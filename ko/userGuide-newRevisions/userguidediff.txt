+Previously NVDA would load custom code directly from the user configuration directory, with no way of disabling this.
+This option is off by default, ensuring that no untested code is ever run in NVDA with out the user's explicit knowledge.
+If you wish to distribute custom code to others, you should package it as an NVDA add-on.

+==== Enable selective registration for UI Automation events and property changes ====[AdvancedSettingsSelectiveUIAEventRegistration]
+This option changes how NVDA registers for events fired by the Microsoft UI Automation accessibility API.
+When this option is disabled, NVDA registers for many UIA events that are processed and discarded within NVDA itself.
+This has a major negative impact on performance, especially in applications like Microsoft Visual Studio.
+Therefore, when this option is enabled, NVDA will limit event registration to the system focus for most events.
+If you suffer from performance issues in one or more applications, We recommend you to try this functionality to see whether performance improves.
+
+==== Use UI automation to access Microsoft Word document controls when available ====[AdvancedSettingsUseUiaForWord]
+When this option is enabled, NVDA will try to use the Microsoft UI Automation accessibility API in order to fetch information from Microsoft Word document controls.
+This includes Microsoft Word itself, and also the Microsoft Outlook message viewer and composer.
+ For the most recent versions of Microsoft Office 2016/365 running on windows 10, UI Automation support is complete enough to provide access to Microsoft Word documents almost equal to NVDA's existing Microsoft Word support, with the added advantage that responsiveness is majorly increased.
+However, There may be some information which is either not exposed, or exposed incorrectly in some versions of Microsoft Office, which means this UI automation support cannot always be relied upon.

+==== Use the new typed character support in Windows Console when available ====[AdvancedSettingsKeyboardSupportInLegacy]

+While it improves performance and prevents some console output from being spelled out, it may be incompatible with some terminal programs.
+This feature is available and enabled by default on Windows 10 versions 1607and later when UI Automation is unavailable or disabled.
+Warning: with this option enabled, typed characters that do not appear onscreen, such as passwords, will not be suppressed.
+In untrusted environments, you may temporarily disable [speak typed characters #KeyboardSettingsSpeakTypedCharacters] and [speak typed words #KeyboardSettingsSpeakTypedWords] when entering passwords.
+
+==== Attempt to cancel speech for expired focus events ====[CancelExpiredFocusSpeech]

++++ Incompatible Add-ons Manager +++[incompatibleAddonsManager]
+The Incompatible Add-ons Manager, which can be accessed via the "view incompatible add-ons" button in the Add-on manager, allows you to inspect any incompatible add-ons, and the reason they are considered incompatible.
+Add-ons are considered incompatible when they have not been updated to work with significant changes to NVDA, or when they rely on a feature not available in the version of NVDA you are using.
+The Incompatible add-ons manager has a short message to explain its purpose as well as the version of NVDA.
+The incompatible add-ons are presented in a list with the following columns:
++ Package, the name of the add-on
++ Version, the version of the add-on
++ Incompatible reason, an explanation of why the add-on is considered incompatible

+
+This can happen i.e. after installing and uninstalling Adobe Reader, Math Player and other programs.
+
+The missing registration can cause issues in browsers, desktop apps, task bar and other interfaces.
+
+Specifically, following issues can be solved by running this tool:
+- NVDA reports "unknown" when navigating in browsers such as Firefox, Thunderbird etc.
+- NVDA fails to switch between focus mode and browse mode
+- NVDA is very slow when navigating in browsers while using browse mode
