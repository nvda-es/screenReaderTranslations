==== Force UI Automation in the Windows Console====[AdvancedSettingsConsoleUIA]
When this option is enabled, NVDA will use a new, work in progress version of its support for Windows Console which takes advantage of [accessibility improvements made by Microsoft https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/whats-new-in-windows-console-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update/]. This feature is highly experimental and is still incomplete, so its use is not yet recommended. However, once completed, it is anticipated that this new support will become the default, improving NVDA's performance and stability in Windows command consoles.

+{==== Speak passwords in UIA consoles ====[AdvancedSettingsWinConsoleSpeakPasswords]
This setting controls whether characters are spoken by [speak typed characters #KeyboardSettingsSpeakTypedCharacters] or [speak typed words #KeyboardSettingsSpeakTypedWords] in situations where the screen does not update (such as password entry) in the Windows Console with UI automation support enabled. For security purposes, this setting should be left disabled. However, you may wish to enable it if you experience performance issues or instability with typed character and/or word reporting while using NVDA's new experimental console support.}+
