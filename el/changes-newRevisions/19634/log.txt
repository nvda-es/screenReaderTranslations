    UIA in Windows Console: rename is21H1Plus (PR #12094)
    
    Fix for microsoft/terminal#9239
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Windows 10 21H1 has been released to insiders with significantly reduced scope (i.e. excluding the UIA changes it was originally set to include), making our internal names misleading. Additionally, there are plans to "undock" conhost from Windows, removing the guarantee that a given Windows version will run a particular version of the console (it's technically already possible to run newer console on older Windows, I do it for testing).
    
    Description of how this pull request fixes the issue:
    Renames:
    - NVDAObjects.UIA.winConsoleUIA.is21H1Plus -> NVDAObjects.UIA.winConsoleUIA.isImprovedTextRangeAvailable
    - NVDAObjects.UIA.winConsoleUIA.consoleUIATextInfo -> NVDAObjects.UIA.winConsoleUIA.ConsoleUIATextInfo (Start class name with upper case)
    - NVDAObjects.UIA.winConsoleUIA.consoleUIATextInfoPre21H1 -> NVDAObjects.UIA.winConsoleUIA.ConsoleUIATextInfoWorkaroundEndInclusive
      - The implementation works around both end points being inclusive (in text ranges) before microsoft/terminal#4018
      - Workarounds for expand, collapse, compareEndPoints, setEndPoint, etc
    
    Also moves the text override to the workaround textInfo as #10036 is no longer reproducible in new console.
