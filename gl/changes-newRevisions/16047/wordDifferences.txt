== New Features ==
- The find dialog now includes a history of the last 20 searches. (#8482)
 - The search history is cleared when NVDA exits or restarts.
- NVDA's Miranda NG support  works with newer versions of the client. (#9053) 
- You can now disable browse mode by default by disabling the new "Enable browse mode on page load" option in NVDA's browse mode settings. (#8716) 
 - Note that when this option is disabled, you can still enable browse mode manually by pressing NVDA+space.
- You can now filter symbols in the punctuation/symbol pronunciation dialog, similar to how filtering works in the elements list and input gestures dialog. (#5761)
- A command has been added to change the mouse text unit resolution (how much text will be spoken when the mouse moves), it has not been assigned a default gesture. (#9056)
- The windows OneCore synthesizer now has a rate boost option, which allows for significantly faster speech. (#7498)
- The Rate Boost option is now configurable from the Synth Settings Ring for supported speech synthesizers. (Currently eSpeak-NG and Windows OneCore). (#8934)
- Configuration profiles can now be manually activated with gestures. (#4209)
 - The gesture must be configured in the "Input gestures" dialog.
- In Eclipse, added support for autocompletion in code editor. (#5667)
 - Additionally, Javadoc information can be read from the editor when it is present by using NVDA+d.
- Added an experimental option to the Advanced Settings panel that allows you to stop the system focus from following the browse mode cursor (Automatically set system focus to focusable elements). (#2039) Although this may not be suitable to turn off for all websites, this may fix: 
 - Rubber band effect: NVDA sporadically undoes the last browse mode keystroke by jumping to the previous location.
 - Edit boxes steal system focus when arrowing down through them on some websites.
 - Browse mode keystrokes are slow to respond.
- For braille display drivers that support it, driver settings can now be changed from the braille settings category in NVDA's settings dialog. (#7452)


== Changes ==
- Synthesizer volume is now increased and decreased by 5 instead of 10 when using the settings ring. (#6754)
- Clarified the text in the add-on manager when NVDA is launched with the --disable-addons flag. (#9473)
- Updated Unicode Common Locale Data Repository emoji annotations to version 35.0. (#9445)
- Updated liblouis braille translator to version 3.9.0. (#9439)
- The hotkey for the filter field in the elements list in browse mode has changed to alt+y. (#8728)


== Bug Fixes ==
- NVDA no longer crashes when an add-on directory is empty. (#7686)
- LTR and RTL marks are no longer reported in Braille or per-character speech when accessing the properties window. (#8361)
- When jumping to form fields with Browse Mode quick navigation, the entire form field is now announced rather than just the first line. (#9388)
- NVDA will no longer become silent after exiting the Windows 10 Mail app. (#9341)
- NVDA no longer fails to start when the users regional settings are set to a locale unknown to NVDA, such as English (Netherlands). (#8726)
- When browse mode is enabled in Microsoft Excel and you switch to a browser in focus mode or vice versa, browse mode state is now reported appropriately. (#8846)
- NVDA now properly reports the line at the mouse cursor in Notepad++ and other Scintilla based editors. (#5450)
- In Google Docs (and other web-based editors), braille no longer sometimes incorrectly shows "lst end" before the cursor in the middle of a list item. (#9477)
- In the Windows 10 May 2019 Update, NVDA no longer speaks many volume notifications if changing the volume with hardware buttons when File Explorer has focus. (#9466)
- Loading the punctuation/symbol pronunciation dialog is now much faster when using symbol dictionaries containing over 1000 entries. (#8790)
- In Scintilla controls such as Notepad++, NVDA can read the correct line when wordwrap is enabled. (#9424)
- In Microsoft Excel, the cell location is announced after it changes due to the shift+enter or shift+numpadEnter gestures. (#9499)
- In Visual Studio 2017 and up, in the Objects Explorer window, the selected item in objects tree or members tree with categories is now reported correctly. (#9311)
- Add-ons with names that only differ in capitalization are no longer treated as separate add-ons. (#9334)
- For Windows OneCore voices, the rate set in NVDA is no longer affected by the rate set in Windows 10 Speech Settings. (#7498)
- The log can now be opened with NVDA+F1 when there is no developer info for the current navigator object. (#8613)
- It is again possible to use NvDA's table navigation commands in Google Docs, in Firefox and Chrome. (#9494)
