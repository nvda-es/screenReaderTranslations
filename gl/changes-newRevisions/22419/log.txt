    Add-on store: correctly refresh cache when filtering incompatible add-ons (#15418)
    
    Fixes #15411
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When unchecking 'Include incompatible add-ons', incompatible add-ons are still included in the list.
    This is due to the cache of the compatible add-ons being updated to include incompatible add-ons.
    This is due to a referencing problem, where the listed add-ons and the compatible add-on cache used the same reference.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Unchecking "include incompatible add-ons" should now correctly return the list to only show compatible add-ons
    
    Description of development approach
    A copy of the cache should be used instead, to prevent external functions from updating the cached copy.
