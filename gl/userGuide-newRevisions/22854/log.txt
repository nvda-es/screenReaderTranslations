    User guide: Update the section on reading math to recommend MathCAT, and also clarify some information about MathPlayer. (#16062)
    
    Fixes #16036
    Fixes #15352
    
    Summary of the issue:
    When reading the section of the User guide about Math support, and then the MathPlayer page from Wiris, it is unclear as to whether MathPlayer is actually needed for NvDA unless you are using an older browser such as Internet Explorer 8.
    Also, Nthe User Guide does not recommend let alone mention, MathCAT, which is now the replacement for the older and unmaintained MathPlayer.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Update the math section in the User guide to mention and recommend MathCAT, and clarify that MathPlayer is still relevant on newer browsers.
