==== Enable loading custom code from Developer Scratchpad Directory ====
When developing add-ons for NVDA, it is useful to be able to test code as you are writing it.
This option when enabled, allows NVDA to load custom appModules, globalPlugins, brailleDisplayDrivers and synthDrivers, from a special developer scratchpad directory in your NVDA user configuration directory.
Previously NVDA would load custom code directly from the user configuration directory, with no way of disabling this.
This option is off by default, ensuring that no untested code is ever run in NVDA with out the user's explicit knowledge.
If you wish to distribute custom code to others, you should package it as an NVDA add-on.

This button opens the directory where you can place custom code while developing it.
This button is only enabled if NVDA is configured to enable loading custom code from the Developer Scratchpad Directory.
 
==== Use UI automation to access Microsoft Word document controls when available ====
When this option is enabled, NVDA will try to use  the Microsoft UI Automation accessibility api in order to fetch information from Microsoft Word document controls.
This includes in Microsoft Word itself, and also the Microsoft Outlook message viewer and composer.
 For the most recent versions of Microsoft Office 2016/365 running on windows 10, UI Automation support is complete enough to provide access to Microsoft Word documents almost equal to NVDA's existing Microsoft Word support, with the added advantage that responsiveness is majorly increased.
However, There may be some information which is either not exposed, or exposed incorrectly in some versions of Microsoft Office, which means this UI automation support cannot always be relied upon.
We still do not recommend that  the majority of users turn this on by default, though we do welcome users of Office 2016/365 to test this feature and provide feedback.

==== Caret move timeout (in MS) ====
This option allows you to configure the number of mili seconds NVDA will wait for the caret (insertion point) to move in editable text controls.
