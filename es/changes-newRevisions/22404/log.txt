    NVDA menu: add explicit shortcut keys and avoid collisions (#15364)
    
    Closes #15362
    
    Summary of the issue:
    "Add-on store" item has been added with "S" as a shortcut key in NVDA tools menu in NVDA 2023.2.
    Unfortunately "S" was already used for "Speech viewer" (as its first letter), even if it was not defined explicitly. Now that there is an explicit mapping for "Add-on store", implicit shortcut key definition for "Speech viewer" becomes masked and does not work anymore.
    
    In case the add-ons add new items in the menus with explicit definition of shortcut keys, other menu item that only use implicit definition of the shortcut key may be masked as well.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Explicitly define shortcut keys in main NVDA menu and avoid collisions (i.e. two times the same letter in the same menu).
    
    Description of development approach
    In main NVDA menu:
    
    "Tools: add explicitly "T"
    "Reset configuration to factory defaults")": Change "R" to "F" because was already used by "Revert to saved configuration"
    "Donate": add explicitly "D"
    In "Tools" submenu:
    
    "Reload plugins e": change "R" to "E" since "R" already taken by "Run COM Registration Fixing tool..."
    "Add-on store": "A" instead of "S", as discussed in Speech viewer no longer has a shortcut key in the tools menu in 2023.2 #15362 (comment), to avoid collision with "Speech viewer"
    "View log": "L" instead of "V" to be more intuitive, as discussed in NVDA menu: add explicit shortcut keys and avoid collisions #15364 (comment)
    For all other items, explicitly mark the accelerator
    Help menu:
    
    "About": Explicitly set "A"
    All other items are already explicitly marked.
