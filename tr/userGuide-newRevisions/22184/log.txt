    Disable WASAPI by default (#15172)
    
    Changes to handle #15150
    Follow up to #14697, #14896, #15038, #15097, #15145
    
    Summary of the issue:
    WASAPI usage is known to cause intermittent crashing in #15150.
    Generally, WASAPI code has not been proven to be stable.
    Due to this, it should not be enabled by default in 2023.2.
    WASAPI can be re-enabled by default once it is proven to be stable.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Disable WASAPI by default, preventing intermittent crashing #15150
    
    Description of development approach
    Turn the WASAPI checkbox into a feature flag, so that it can easily be re-enabled in future.
    
    Testing strategy:
    Manual testing
    Upgrading the profile: Test starting NVDA with the WASAPI config value set to "True/False" instead of a "enabled/disabled/default".
    
    Test the various controls related to WASAPI - ensure they are saved, applied and respected correctly.
