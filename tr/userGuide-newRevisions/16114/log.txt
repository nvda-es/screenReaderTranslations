    UI Automation in Windows Console: make speaking of passwords configurable (#9649)
    
    * Don't speak off-screen text (like passwords) in console windows.
    
    This approach works on my system, but needs wider testing.
    
    * Speaking of passwords is now configurable in UIA consoles, add accelerators for UIA console options in the GUI.
    
    * Clarify user guide.
    
    * Allow the password toggle to be restored.
