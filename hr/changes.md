# ﻿Što je novo u NVDA

## 2024.3

Add-on store će vas obavijestiti o dostupnosti ažuriranja dodataka prilikom pokretanja NVDA.

Dodane su opcije za primjenu unicode normalizacije na govor i brajicu.
To može biti korisno pri čitanju znakova koji su nepoznati određenoj govornoj jedinici ili ne postoje u određenoj brajičnoj tablici. Takvi znakovi mogu imati kompatibilnu alternativu, poput podebljanih ili kosih slova koja se uobičajeno koriste na društvenim mrežama.
Ta opcija također omogućuje čitanje jednadžbi u Microsoft Word uređivaču jednadžbi.

Help Tech Activator Pro brajični redci su sada podržani.

Dodane su nedodijeljene geste za pomicanje kotačića miša vertikalno ili horizontalno.

Ispravljeno je nekoliko pogrešaka, prije svega u Windows 11 emoji panelu i povijesti međuspremnika.
Dodane su ispravke u web preglednicima za čitanje poruka o pogreškama, figure, crteže, oznake tablica te potvrdne okvire i izborne gumbe.

Liblouis je nadograđen sa dodanom podrškom za srpsku ćirilicu, Jidiš, nekoliko drevnih jezika, turski i međunarodnu fonetsku abecedu.
eSpeak je nadograđen sa dodanom podrškom za karakalpački.
Unicode CLDR je također nadograđen.

### nove značajke

* Novi tipkovnički prečaci:
  * Dodani su prečaci za vertikalno i horizontalno pomicanje kotačića miša, kako bi se unaprijedilo kretanje u nekim aplikacijama i na nekim web stranicama čiji se sadržaj osvježava, kao što je to na primjer Dism++. (#16462, @Cary-Rowen)
* Dodana podrška za Unicode normalizaciju za govor i brajicu. (#11570, #16466 @LeonarddeR).
  * To može biti korisno kada je određeni znak nepoznat za govornu jedinicu ili ne postoji u brajičnoj tablici, ali ima kompatibilnu alternativu kao što su to na primjer podebljani ili kosi znakovi koji se uobičajeno koriste na društvenim mrežama.
  * To također omogućuje čitanje jednadžbi u Microsoft Word uređivaču jednadžbi. (#4631)
  * Ovu značajku možete uključiti za govor i brajicu u dijaloškom okviru postavki u pripadajućim kategorijama.
* Od sada ćete biti podrazumijevano obavješteni o novim ažuriranjima dodataka prilikom pokretanja NVDA. (#15035)
  * To se može isključiti u "Add-on Store" kategoriji u postavkama.
  * NVDA provjerava svakodnevno za ažuriranje NVDA dodataka.
  * Provjeravat će se ažuriranja samo za jedan kanal (na primjer instalirani beta dodaci će biti provjeravani iz beta kanala).
* Dodana podrška za Help Tech Activator Pro brajične redke. (#16668)

* Support for custom braille tables has been added. (#3304, #16208, @JulienCochuyt, @LeonarddeR)
  * Tables can be provided in the `brailleTables` folder in an add-on package.
  * Table metadata can be added to an optional `brailleTables` section in the add-on manifest or to a `.ini` file with the same format found in the brailleTables subdirectory of the scratchpad directory.
  * Please consult the [braille translation tables section in the developer guide](https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/developerGuide.html#BrailleTables) for more details.
* When a `gainFocus` event is queued with an object that has a valid `focusRedirect` property, the object pointed to by the `focusRedirect` property is now held by `eventHandler.lastQueuedFocusObject`, rather than the originally queued object. (#15843)
* NVDA will log its executable architecture (x86) at startup. (#16432, @josephsl)
* `wx.CallAfter`, which is wrapped in `monkeyPatches/wxMonkeyPatches.py`, now includes proper `functools.wraps` indication. (#16520, @XLTechie)
* There is a new module for scheduling tasks `utils.schedule`, using the pip module `schedule`. (#16636)
  * You can use `scheduleThread.scheduleDailyJobAtStartUp` to automatically schedule a job that happens after NVDA starts, and every 24 hours after that.
  Jobs are scheduled with a delay to avoid conflicts.
  * `scheduleThread.scheduleDailyJob` and `scheduleJob` can be used to schedule jobs at custom times, where a `JobClashError` will be raised on a known job scheduling clash.
* It is now possible to create app modules for apps hosting Edge WebView2 (msedgewebview2.exe) controls. (#16705, @josephsl)

## 2024.2

## 2024.1

Dodan je novi modus govora čitanja informacija na zahtjev.
Kada je modus govora postavljen da izgovara informacije na zahtjev, NVDA ne čita informacije automatski na primjer prilikom pomicanja kursora, ali još uvijek izgovara informacije i koje se dobivaju uz pomoć prečaca, čiji je cilj izgovaranja određenih informacija na primjer, izgovaranje naslovne trake.
U kategoriji "govor" NVDA postavki, sada je moguće izostavljanje neželjenih modusa govora iz odabira modusa govora (`NVDA+s`).

Novi način kopiranja sa sačuvanim oblikovanjem, koji se poziva uz pomoć prečaca `NVDA+shift+f10` dostupan je na web stranicama u Mozilla Firefoxu.
Kada se uključi, koristit će se izvorno označavanje u Mozilli firefoxu.
Kopiranje teksta uz pomoć prečaca `control+c` biti će proslijeđeno direktno Mozilli firefoxu što znači da će tekst biti kopiran sa sačuvanim oblikovanjem, umjesto čistog teksta bez oblikovanja.

NVDA store sada podržava višestruke radnje na primjer: instaliranje ili uključivanje dodataka tako da se označi više dodataka
Dodana je nova radnja za otvaranje web stranice recenzija za bilo koji označeni dodatak.

Opcije odabira zvučne kartice i načina stišavanja govora su uklonjene iz dijaloškog okvira "odabir govorne jedinice".
Ove se opcije mogu pronaći u novom dijaloškom okviru postavki zvuka koji se poziva prečacem `NVDA+control+u`.

Nadograđeni su eSpeak-NG, LibLouis braille translator, i Unicode CLDR.
Dodane su nove brajične tablice za tajski, filipinski i rumunjski jezik.

Ispravljeno je puno pogrešaka, uglavnom u Add-on Storeu, podršci za brajicu, Libre Officeu, Microsoft Officeu i podršci za zvuk.

### Važne napomene

* Ova inačica narušava kompatibilnost sa postojećim dodacima.
* Windows 7, i Windows 8 više nisu podržani operacijski sustavi.
Windows 8.1 je minimalna verzija operacijskog sustava Windows.

### Nove značajke

* Add-on Store:
  * Add-on Store sada podržava višestruke radnje na primjer instaliranje, uključivanje više dodataka) tako da se odabere više dodataka. (#15350, #15623, @CyrilleB79)
  * Dodana je opcija koja služi za davanje povratne informacije o dodacima putem posebne web stranice za svaki dodatak. (#15576, @nvdaes)
* Dodana podrška za Bluetooth niskonaponske brajične redke. (#15470)
* Dodano je kopiranje sa sačuvanim oblikovanjem (koje se uključuje ili isključuje uz pomoć prečaca `NVDA+shift+f10`) na web stranicama u Mozilla firefoxu.
Kada je uključeno, koristit će se izvorno označavanje u Mozilla firefoxu.
Prilikom kopiranja teksta uz pomoć prečaca `control+c` biti će proslijeđeno izravno Firefoxu, što će kopirati i formatiranje, a ne samo oblikovanje.
Imajte na umu da prilikom kopiranja teksta i njegovim rukovanjem od strane Firefoxa, NVDA neće izgovoriti poruku "kopirano u međuspremnik". (#15830)
* Prilikom kopiranja teksta u Microsoft Wordu sa uključenim načinom čitanja, oblikovanje će se također kopirati.
Posljedica ovoga je da NVDA neće izgovarati poruku "kopirano u međuspremnik" kada se pritisne `control+c` u Microsoft wordu ili Outlooku, zbog toga što aplikacija upravlja kopiranjem., umjesto NVDA. (#16129)
* Dodan je novi modus govora "na zahtjev".
Kada je govor podešen na zahtjev, NVDA neće govoriti automatski (na primjer, prilikom pomicanja kursora) ali govori kada se pozivaju prečaci čiji je cilj čitanje određene informacije (na primjer izgovaranje naslovne trake). (#481, @CyrilleB79)
* U kategoriji govor postavki NVDA, sada je moguće isključiti neželjene moduse govora iz odabira prečacem odabira modusa govora (`NVDA+s`). (#15806, @lukaszgo1)
  * Ako koristite dodatak NoBeepsSpeechMode razmislite o njegovom uklanjanju, i onemogućavanjem "zvučnih signala" "i načina na zahtjev" u postavkama.

### Izmjene

* NVDA više ne podržava Windows 7 i Windows 8.
Windows 8.1 je minimalna podržana verzija sustava Windows. (#15544)
* Nadogradnje komponenata:
  * Nadograđen LibLouis brajični prevoditelj na inačicu [3.28.0](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases/tag/v3.28.0). (#15435, #15876, @codeofdusk)
    * Dodane nove brajične tablice za Tajski, Rumunjski i Filipinski.

  * Nadograđena Java Access Bridge na 17.0.9+8Zulu (17.46.19). (#15744)
* Tipkovnički prečaci:
  * Slijedeći tipkovnički prečaci od sada podržavaju dvostruke i trostruke pritiske za slovkanje informacije, te sricanje uz pomoć fonetskog opisa znakova: čitaj označeni tekst, čitaj tekst u međuspremniku i čitaj fokusirani objekt. (#15449, @CyrilleB79)
  * Prečac za uključivanje i isključivanje zaslonske zavjese sada ima podrazumjevani tipkovnički prečac: `NVDA+control+escape`. (#10560, @CyrilleB79)

### Changes for Developers

Please refer to [the developer guide](https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/developerGuide.html#API) for information on NVDA's API deprecation and removal process.

* Note: this is an Add-on API compatibility breaking release.
Add-ons will need to be re-tested and have their manifest updated.
* Building NVDA now requires Visual Studio 2022.
Please refer to the [NVDA docs](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/blob/release-2024.1/projectDocs/dev/createDevEnvironment.md) for the specific list of Visual Studio components. (#14313)
* Added the following extension points:
  * `treeInterceptorHandler.post_browseModeStateChange`. (#14969, @nvdaes)
  * `speech.speechCanceled`. (#15700, @LeonarddeR)
  * `_onErrorSoundRequested` (should be retrieved calling `logHandler.getOnErrorSoundRequested()`) (#15691, @CyrilleB79)
* It is now possible to use plural forms in an add-on's translations. (#15661, @beqabeqa473)
* Included python3.dll in the binary distribution for use by add-ons with external libraries utilizing the [stable ABI](https://docs.python.org/3.11/c-api/stable.html). (#15674, @mzanm)
* The `BrailleDisplayDriver` base class now has `numRows` and `numCols` properties to provide information about multi line braille displays.
Setting `numCells` is still supported for single line braille displays and `numCells` will return the total number of cells for multi line braille displays. (#15386)
* Updated BrlAPI for BRLTTY to version 0.8.5, and its corresponding python module to a Python 3.11 compatible build. (#15652, @LeonarddeR)
* Added the `speech.speakSsml` function, which allows you to write NVDA speech sequences using [SSML](https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis11/). (#15699, @LeonarddeR)
  * The following tags are currently supported and translated to appropriate NVDA speech commands:
    * `Prosody` (`pitch`, `rate` and `volume`). Only multiplication (e.g. `200%` are supported.
    * `say-as` with the `interpret` attribute set to `characters`
    * `voice` with the `xml:lang` set to an XML language
    * `break` with the `time` attribute set to a value in milliseconds, e.g. `200ms`
    * `mark` with the `name` attribute set to a mark name, e.g. `mark1`, requires providing a callback
  * Example: `speech.speakSsml('<speak><prosody pitch="200%">hello</prosody><break time="500ms" /><prosody rate="50%">John</prosody></speak>')`
  * The SSML parsing capabilities are backed by the `SsmlParser` class in the `speechXml` module.
* Changes to the NVDA Controller Client library:
  * The file names of the library no longer contain a suffix denoting the architecture, i.e. `nvdaControllerClient32/64.dll` are now called `nvdaControllerClient.dll`. (#15718, #15717, @LeonarddeR)
  * Added an example to demonstrate using nvdaControllerClient.dll from Rust. (#15771, @LeonarddeR)
  * Added the following functions to the controller client: (#15734, #11028, #5638, @LeonarddeR)
    * `nvdaController_getProcessId`: To get the process id (PID) of the current instance of NVDA the controller client is using.
    * `nvdaController_speakSsml`: To instruct NVDA to speak according to the given SSML. This function also supports:
      * Providing the symbol level.
      * Providing the priority of speech to be spoken.
      * Speaking both synchronously (blocking) and asynchronously (instant return).
    * `nvdaController_setOnSsmlMarkReachedCallback`: To register a callback of type `onSsmlMarkReachedFuncType` that is called in synchronous mode for every `<mark />` tag encountered in the SSML sequence provided to `nvdaController_speakSsml`.
  * Note: the new functions in the controller client only support NVDA 2024.1 and above.
* Updated `include` dependencies:
  * detours to `4b8c659f549b0ab21cf649377c7a84eb708f5e68`. (#15695)
  * ia2 to `3d8c7f0b833453f761ded6b12d8be431507bfe0b`. (#15695)
  * sonic to `8694c596378c24e340c09ff2cd47c065494233f1`. (#15695)
  * w3c-aria-practices to `9a5e55ccbeb0f1bf92b6127c9865da8426d1c864`. (#15695)
  * wil to `5e9be7b2d2fe3834a7107f430f7d4c0631f69833`. (#15695)
* Device info yielded by `hwPortUtils.listUsbDevices` now contain the bus reported description of the USB device (key `busReportedDeviceDescription`). (#15764, @LeonarddeR)
* For USB serial devices, `bdDetect.getConnectedUsbDevicesForDriver` and `bdDetect.getDriversForConnectedUsbDevices` now yield device matches containing a `deviceInfo` dictionary enriched with data about the USB device, such as `busReportedDeviceDescription`. (#15764, @LeonarddeR)
* When the configuration file `nvda.ini` is corrupted, a backup copy is saved before it is reinitialized. (#15779, @CyrilleB79)
* When defining a script with the script decorator, the `speakOnDemand` boolean argument can be specified to control if a script should speak while in "on-demand" speech mode. (#481, @CyrilleB79)
  * Scripts that provide information (e.g. say window title, report time/date) should speak in the "on-demand" mode.
  * Scripts that perform an action (e.g. move the cursor, change a parameter) should not speak in the "on-demand" mode.
* Fixed bug where deleting git-tracked files during `scons -c` resulted in missing UIA COM interfaces on rebuild. (#7070, #10833, @hwf1324)
* Fix a bug where some code changes were not detected when building `dist`, that prevented a new build from being triggered.
Now `dist` always rebuilds. (#13372, @hwf1324)
* A `gui.nvdaControls.MessageDialog` with default type of standard, no longer throws a None conversion exception because no sound is assigned. (#16223, @XLTechie)

#### API Breaking Changes

These are breaking API changes.
Please open a GitHub issue if your Add-on has an issue with updating to the new API.

* NVDA is now built with Python 3.11. (#12064)
* Updated pip dependencies:
  * configobj to 5.1.0dev commit `e2ba4457c4651fa54f8d59d8dcdd3da950e956b8`. (#15544)
  * Comtypes to 1.2.0. (#15513, @codeofdusk)
  * Flake8 to 4.0.1. (#15636, @lukaszgo1)
  * py2exe to 0.13.0.1dev commit `4e7b2b2c60face592e67cb1bc935172a20fa371d`. (#15544) 
  * robotframework to 6.1.1. (#15544)
  * SCons to 4.5.2. (#15529, @LeonarddeR)
  * sphinx to 7.2.6. (#15544)
  * wxPython to 4.2.2a commit `0205c7c1b9022a5de3e3543f9304cfe53a32b488`. (#12551, #16257)
* Removed pip dependencies:
  * typing_extensions, these should be supported natively in Python 3.11 (#15544)
  * nose, instead unittest-xml-reporting is used to generate XML reports. (#15544)
* `IAccessibleHandler.SecureDesktopNVDAObject` has been removed.
Instead, when NVDA is running on the user profile, track the existence of the secure desktop with the extension point: `winAPI.secureDesktop.post_secureDesktopStateChange`. (#14488)
* `braille.BrailleHandler.handlePendingCaretUpdate` has been removed with no public replacement. (#15163, @LeonarddeR)
* `bdDetect.addUsbDevices and bdDetect.addBluetoothDevices` have been removed.
Braille display drivers should implement the `registerAutomaticDetection` class method instead.
That method receives a `DriverRegistrar` object on which the `addUsbDevices` and `addBluetoothDevices` methods can be used. (#15200, @LeonarddeR)
* The default implementation of the check method on `BrailleDisplayDriver` now requires both the `threadSafe` and `supportsAutomaticDetection` attributes to be set to `True`. (#15200, @LeonarddeR)
* Passing lambda functions to `hwIo.ioThread.IoThread.queueAsApc` is no longer possible, as functions should be weakly referenceable. (#14627, @LeonarddeR)
* `IoThread.autoDeleteApcReference` has been removed. (#14924, @LeonarddeR)
* To support capital pitch changes, synthesizers must now explicitly declare their support for the `PitchCommand` in the `supportedCommands` attribute on the driver. (#15433, @LeonarddeR)
* `speechDictHandler.speechDictVars` has been removed. Use `NVDAState.WritePaths.speechDictsDir` instead of `speechDictHandler.speechDictVars.speechDictsPath`. (#15614, @lukaszgo1)
* `languageHandler.makeNpgettext` and `languageHandler.makePgettext` have been removed.
`npgettext` and `pgettext` are supported natively now. (#15546)
* The app module for [Poedit](https://poedit.net) has been changed significantly. The `fetchObject` function has been removed. (#15313, #7303, @LeonarddeR)
* The following redundant types and constants have been removed from `hwPortUtils`: (#15764, @LeonarddeR)
  * `PCWSTR`
  * `HWND` (replaced by `ctypes.wintypes.HWND`)
  * `ULONG_PTR`
  * `ULONGLONG`
  * `NULL`
  * `GUID` (replaced by `comtypes.GUID`)
* `gui.addonGui.AddonsDialog` has been removed. (#15834)
* `touchHandler.TouchInputGesture.multiFingerActionLabel` has been removed with no replacement. (#15864, @CyrilleB79)
* `NVDAObjects.IAccessible.winword.WordDocument.script_reportCurrentHeaders` has been removed with no replacement. (#15904, @CyrilleB79)
* The following app modules are removed.
Code which imports from one of them, should instead import from the replacement module. (#15618, @lukaszgo1)

    * Opcije za promjenu zvučne kartice i utišavanje zvukova premještene su u novu kategoriju postavki zvuka iz dijaloškog okvira odabira govorne jedinice.
    Ove će opcije biti uklonjene iz dijaloškog okvira  "odaberi govornu jedinicu" u inačici 2024.1. (#15486, #8711)
  * NVDA will now output audio via the Windows Audio Session API (WASAPI), which may improve the responsiveness, performance and stability of NVDA speech and sounds. (#14697, #11169, #11615, #5096, #10185, #11061)
  * Upozorenje: WASAPI je nekompatibilan sa nekim dodacima.
  Dostupne su kompatibilne nadogradnje tih dodataka, Nadogradite ih prije nadogradnje NVDA.
  Nekompatibilne verzije tih dodataka bit će isključene prilikom nadogradnje NVDA:

### Changes for Developers

Please refer to [the developer guide](https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/developerGuide.html#API) for information on NVDA's API deprecation and removal process.

* `braille.handler.handleUpdate` and `braille.handler.handleReviewMove` have been changed in order not to update instantly.
Before this change, when either of these methods was called very often, this would drain many resources.
These methods now queue an update at the end of every core cycle instead.
They should also be thread safe, making it possible to call them from background threads. (#15163)
* Added official support to register custom braille display drivers in the automatic braille display detection process.
Consult the `braille.BrailleDisplayDriver` class documentation for more details.
Most notably, the `supportsAutomaticDetection` attribute must be set to `True` and the `registerAutomaticDetection` `classmethod` must be implemented.  (#15196)

#### Deprecations

* `braille.BrailleHandler.handlePendingCaretUpdate` is now deprecated with no public replacement.
It will be removed in 2024.1. (#15163)
* Importing the constants `xlCenter`, `xlJustify`, `xlLeft`, `xlRight`, `xlDistributed`, `xlBottom`, `xlTop` from `NVDAObjects.window.excel` is deprecated.
Use `XlHAlign` or `XlVAlign` enumerations instead. (#15205)
* The mapping `NVDAObjects.window.excel.alignmentLabels` is deprecated.
Use the `displayString` methods of `XlHAlign` or `XlVAlign` enumerations instead. (#15205)
* `bdDetect.addUsbDevices` and `bdDetect.addBluetoothDevices` have been deprecated.
Braille display drivers should implement the `registerAutomaticDetection` classmethod instead.
That method receives a `DriverRegistrar` object on which the `addUsbDevices` and `addBluetoothDevices` methods can be used. (#15200)
* The default implementation of the check method on `BrailleDisplayDriver` uses `bdDetect.driverHasPossibleDevices` for devices that are marked as thread safe.
Starting from NVDA 2024.1, in order for the base method to use `bdDetect.driverHasPossibleDevices`, the `supportsAutomaticDetection` attribute must be set to `True` as well. (#15200)

## 2023.2

Ova verzija dodaje add-on store koja Zamjenjuje upravljanje dodacima.
U  Add-on storeu možete pregledavati, pretraživati, instalirati i ažurirati dodatke zajednice.
Sada možete ručno ignorirati probleme kompatibilnosti sa zastarjelim dodacima na vlastitu odgovornost.

Dodane su nove funkcije za brajične redke, prečice i novi podržani brajični redci.
Također su dodate nove prečice za OCR i rasklopljeni prikaz kroz objekte.
Navigacija i čitanje oblikovanja u Microsoft Office paketu je poboljšana.

Puno grešaka je ispravljeno, posebno za brajične redke, Microsoft Office, web preglednike i Windows 11.

eSpeak-NG, LibLouis braille translator, i Unicode CLDR su ažurirani.

### Izmjene

* Ažurirane komponente:
  * eSpeak NG je ažuriran na inačicu 1.52-dev commit `ed9a7bcf`. (#15036)
  * Ažuriran LibLouis brajični prevoditelj na inačicu [3.26.0](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases/tag/v3.26.0). (#14970)
  * CLDR je ažuriran na inačicu 43.0. (#14918)
* Izmjene u LibreOffice paketu:
  * Kada se čita pozicija preglednog kursora, trenutna pozicija kursora se sada čita u odnosu na trenutnu stranicu u programu LibreOffice Writer za LibreOffice inačicu 7.6 i novije, slično čitanju u programu Microsoft Word. (#11696)
  * Izgovor trake stanja (na primjer kada se pritisne `NVDA+end`) radi u paketu LibreOffice. (#11698)
  * Kada se prebacite na neku drugu ćeliju u programu LibreOffice Calc, NVDA više neće neispravno izgovarati koordinate prethodno fokusirane ćelije kada se izgovor koordinata ćelija onemogući u NVDA postavkama. (#15098)
* Promjene za brajične redke:
  * Kada se koristi brajični redak uz pomoć upravljačkog programa za Hid brajični standard, dpad se sada može koristiti za emuliranje strelica tipkovnice i entera.
  Takođe,  `razmaknica+točka1` i `razmaknica+točka4` sada se koriste kao strelice dole i gore. (#14713)
  * Ažuriranja dinamičkog sadržaja na Web stranicama (ARIA žive regije) se sada prikazuju na brajičnom redku.
  Ovo se može onemogućiti na panelu naprednih postavki. (#7756)
* Simboli crtica i spojnica će uvijek biti poslani sintetizatoru. (#13830)
* Udaljenost koju Microsoft Word čita će sada poštovati mjernu jedinicu koja je postavljena u naprednim postavkama Worda čak i kada se koristi UIA za pristup Word dokumentima. (#14542)

* Skripta za prijavljivanje odredišta poveznice sada čita sa pozicije kursora ili fokusa umesto objekta navigatora. (#14659)
* Stvaranje prenosne kopije više ne zahtijeva upisivanje slova diska kao dio apsolutne putanje. (#14680)
* Ako je Windows postavljen da prikazuje sekunde na satu područja obavijesti, korištenje prečaca `NVDA+f12` za čitanje vremena sada prati ovo podešavanje. (#14742)
* NVDA će sada prijavljivati grupe bez oznake koje imaju korisne informacijje o poziciji, kakve se mogu pronaći u novijim  inačicama Microsoft Office 365 izbornika. (#14878) 

### Ispravke grešaka

* Brajični redci:
  * Nekoliko poboljšanja u stabilnosti unosa/prikaza na brajičnom redku, što će smanjiti učestalost grešaka i rušenja programa NVDA. (#14627)
  * NVDA se više neće bespotrebno prebacivati na opciju bez brajice više puta u toku automatskog prepoznavanja, što donosi zapisnike i manje opterećenje. (#14524)
  * NVDA će se sada prebacivati na USB ako HID Bluetooth uređaj (kao što je HumanWare Brailliant ili APH Mantis) automatski bude prepoznat i USB veza postane dostupna.
  Ovo je ranije radilo samo za Bluetooth serijske portove. (#14524)
  * Kada nijedan brajični redak nije povezan i preglednik brajičnog redka se zatvori pritiskanjem `alt+f4` ili klikom na gumb zatvori, veličina brajevog podsistema će ponovo biti vraćena na bez ćelija. (#15214)
* Web preglednici:
  * NVDA više neće ponekad izazivati rušenje ili prestanak rada programa Mozilla Firefox. (#14647)

  * Sada možete koristiti modus pretraživanja u Chromium umetnutim kontrolama u kojima to ranije nije bilo moguće. (#13493, #8553)
  * U Mozilli Firefox, pomicanje miša do teksta nakon linka sada ispravno čita tekst. (#9235)
  * Odredište linkova na slikama se sada preciznije ispravno čita u većini slučajeva u programima Chrome i Edge. (#14779)
  * Kada pokušavate čitati adresu poveznice bez href atributa NVDA više neće biti bez govora.
  Umjesto toga NVDA će prijaviti da poveznica  nema odredište. (#14723)
  * U modusu pretraživanja, NVDA neće neispravno ignorirati pomeranje fokusa na glavnu kontrolu ili kontrolu unutar nje na primer pomicanje sa kontrole na njenu unutrašnju stavku popisa ili ćeliju mreže. (#14611)
    * Napomena međutim da se ova ispravka primenjuje samo kada je opcija "Automatsko postavljanje fokusa na stavke koje se mogu fokusirati" u postavkama modusa pretraživanja isključena (što je podrazumevano postaka).
* Ispravke za Windows 11:
  * NVDA ponovo može izgovarati sadržaj trake stanja u bloku za pisanje. (#14573)
  * Prebacivanje između kartica će izgovoriti ime i poziciju nove kartice u bloku za pisanje i upravitelju datoteka. (#14587, #14388)

* Microsoft Office ispravke:
  * Kada se brzo krećete kroz ćelije u Excelu, manja je vjerojatnost prijavljivanja pogrešne ćelije ili pogrešnog odabira. (#14983, #12200, #12108)
  * Kada stanete na Excel ćeliju van radnog lista, brajični redak i označavanje fokusa se više neće bespotrebno ažurirati na objekt koji je ranije bio fokusiran. (#15136)
  * NVDA sada uspješno izgovara fokusiranje na polja za lozinke u programima Microsoft Excel i Outlook. (#14839)
* Za simbole koji nemaju opis na trenutnom jeziku, podrazumjevana Engleska razina simbola će se koristiti. (#14558, #14417)
* Sada je moguće koristiti znak obrnuta kosa crta u polju zamjene unosa rječnika, kada tip nije postavljen kao pravilni izraz. (#14556)
* U kalkulatoru u  Windowsima 10 i 11, a prijenosna kopija NVDA će pravilno čitati izraze u kompaktnom načinu. (#14679)
* NVDA se ponovo oporavlja u brojnim slučajevima kao što su aplikacije koje više ne reagiraju, što je ranije izazivalo da NVDA u potpunosti prestane raditi. (#14759) 
* Kada želite prisilno koristitiUIA podršku u određenim Terminalima i konzolama, ispravljena je greška koja je izazivala rušenje i neprestano pisanje podataka  u zapisniku. (#14689)
* NVDA više neće odbijati spremanje konfiguracije nakon vraćanja postavki na tvorničke. (#13187)
* Kada se pokreće privremena kopija iz instalacije, NVDA neće korisnicima davati pogrešne informacije da postavke mogu biti spremljena. (#14914)
* NVDA sada brže reagira na prečace i promjene fokusa. (#14928)
* Prikazivanje OCR postavki više neće biti neuspješno na nekim sistemima. (#15017)
* Ispravljena greška vezana za spremanje i vraćanje NVDA postavki, uključujući promjenu sintetizatora. (#14760)
* Ispravljena greška koja je izazvala da u pregledu teksta pokret "Povlačenje gore" pomiće stranice umjesto prelaska na prethodni redak. (#15127)

### Changes for Developers

Please refer to [the developer guide](https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/developerGuide.html#API) for information on NVDA's API deprecation and removal process.

* Suggested conventions have been added to the add-on manifest specification.
These are optional for NVDA compatibility, but are encouraged or required for submitting to the Add-on Store. (#14754)
  * Use `lowerCamelCase` for the name field.
  * Use `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` format for the version field (required for add-on datastore).
  * Use `https://` as the schema for the url field (required for add-on datastore).
* Added a new extension point type called `Chain`, which can be used to iterate over iterables returned by registered handlers. (#14531)
* Added the `bdDetect.scanForDevices` extension point.
Handlers can be registered that yield `BrailleDisplayDriver/DeviceMatch` pairs that don't fit in existing categories, like USB or Bluetooth. (#14531)
* Added extension point: `synthDriverHandler.synthChanged`. (#14618)
* The NVDA Synth Settings Ring now caches available setting values the first time they're needed, rather than when loading the synthesizer. (#14704)
* You can now call the export method on a gesture map to export it to a dictionary.
This dictionary can be imported in another gesture by passing it either to the constructor of `GlobalGestureMap` or to the update method on an existing map. (#14582)
* `hwIo.base.IoBase` and its derivatives now have a new constructor parameter to take a `hwIo.ioThread.IoThread`.
If not provided, the default thread is used. (#14627)
* `hwIo.ioThread.IoThread` now has a `setWaitableTimer` method to set a waitable timer using a python function.
Similarly, the new `getCompletionRoutine` method allows you to convert a python method into a completion routine safely. (#14627)
* `offsets.OffsetsTextInfo._get_boundingRects` should now always return `List[locationHelper.rectLTWH]` as expected for a subclass of `textInfos.TextInfo`. (#12424)
* `highlight-color` is now a format field attribute. (#14610)
* NVDA should more accurately determine if a logged message is coming from NVDA core. (#14812)
* NVDA will no longer log inaccurate warnings or errors about deprecated appModules. (#14806)
* All NVDA extension points are now briefly described in a new, dedicated chapter in the Developer Guide. (#14648)
* `scons checkpot` will no longer check the `userConfig` subfolder anymore. (#14820)
* Translatable strings can now be defined with a singular and a plural form using `ngettext` and `npgettext`. (#12445)

#### Deprecations

* Passing lambda functions to `hwIo.ioThread.IoThread.queueAsApc` is deprecated.
Instead, functions should be weakly referenceable. (#14627)
* Importing `LPOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE` from `hwIo.base` is deprecated.
Instead import from `hwIo.ioThread`. (#14627)
* `IoThread.autoDeleteApcReference` is deprecated.
It was introduced in NVDA 2023.1 and was never meant to be part of the public API.
Until removal, it behaves as a no-op, i.e. a context manager yielding nothing. (#14924)
* `gui.MainFrame.onAddonsManagerCommand` is deprecated, use `gui.MainFrame.onAddonStoreCommand` instead. (#13985)
* `speechDictHandler.speechDictVars.speechDictsPath` is deprecated, use `NVDAState.WritePaths.speechDictsDir` instead. (#15021)
* Importing `voiceDictsPath` and `voiceDictsBackupPath` from `speechDictHandler.dictFormatUpgrade` is deprecated.
Instead use `WritePaths.voiceDictsDir` and `WritePaths.voiceDictsBackupDir` from `NVDAState`. (#15048)
* `config.CONFIG_IN_LOCAL_APPDATA_SUBKEY` is deprecated.
Instead use `config.RegistryKey.CONFIG_IN_LOCAL_APPDATA_SUBKEY`. (#15049)

## 2023.1

Dodana je nova opcija, "stil odlomka" u kategoriji "kretanje po dokumentu".
Ona se može koristiti u tekstualnim editorima koji ne podržavaju nativno kretanje po odlomcima, kao što su to Notepad i Notepad++.

Dodan je novi prečac za čitanje odredišta na koje vodi poveznica, određen kao `NVDA+k`.

Podrška za anotiran web sadržaj (poput komentara i rubnih bilježaka) je unaprijeđena.
Pritišćite `NVDA+d` kako biste se kretali po sadržajima (na primjer "ima komentar, ima rubnu bilješku").

Tivomatic Caiku Albatross 46/80 brajični redci su sada podržani.

Podrška za ARM64 i AMD64 inačica sustava Windows je unapređena.

Ispravljeno je mnoštvo grešaka, među kojima ispravke za Windows 11 čine većinu.

eSpeak, LibLouis, Sonic povećivač brzine i Unicode su ažurirani.
Dodane su nove brajične tablice za gruzijski, Swahili (Kenija) i Chichewa (Malawi).

Upozorenje:

* U ovoj inačici narušena je kompatibilnost s postojećim dodacima.

### Nove značajke

* Microsoft Excel s sučeljem UI automation: automatsko čitanje zaglavlja i stupaca tablica. (#14228)
  * Upozorenje: ovo se odnosi na tablice oblikovane uz pomoć gumba "tablica" na kratici umetanje na ribbonu.
  "prvi stupac" i "zaglavlje redka" u "opcijama stila tablice" odnose se na zaglavlja redaka i stupaca.
  * Ovo se ne odnosi na specifična zaglavlja čitača zaslona  uz pomoć imenovanih raspona, koje se ne podržavaju uz pomoć UI automation.
* Dodan je nedodijeljen prečac za uključivanje i isključivanje opisa znakova poslije kursora. (#14267)
* Dodana je podrška za čitanje sadržaja naredbenog redka uz pomoć UIA obavijesti, što ima za cilj unađređenje stabilnosti i responsivnosti. (#13781)
  * Kako biste saznali koja su ograničenja ove opcije, molimo pogledajte korisnički vodič za više informacija.
* U Windowsima 11 ARM64, modus pregleda je sada dostupan u AMD64 aplikacijama poput Firefoxa, Google Chromea i 1Passworda. (#14397)
* Nova opcija je dodana, "Stil odlomaka" u kategoriji "kretanje po dokumentu".
Ovo dodaje podršku za kretanje po pojedinačnim prijelomima redka (normalnim) i višerednim prijelomima redka (blokovnim). 
Ovo se može koristiti sa editorima teksta koji ne podržavaju kretanje po odlomcima nativno, kao što su to Notepad i Notepad++. (#13797)
* Izgovarana je prisutnost više anotacija.
`NVDA+d` sada prebacuje između izgovora sadržaja svake ciljne anotacije za izvore sa višestrukim ciljnim anotacijama.
Na primjer, kada tekst sadrži komentar i fusnotu. (#14507, #14480)
* Dodana je podrška za Tivomatic Caiku Albatross 46/80 brajične redke. (#13045)
* Novi globalni prečac: Čitaj odredište poveznice (`NVDA+k`).
Kada se pritisne jednom odredište linka koje se nalazi u objektu navigatora će biti izgovoreno i i prikazano na brajičnom redku.
Kada se pritisne dvaput, poveznica će biti prikazana u prozoru u svrhu detaljnijeg pregleda. (#14583)
* Nova nedodijeljena gesta (u kategoriji alati): je dodana prikaži odredište poveznice u prozoru.
Isto kao pritisak `NVDA+k` dvaput, ali može biti korisnije za korisnike brajice. (#14583)

### Izmjene

* nadograđen LibLouis brajični prevoditelj na  inačicu [3.24.0](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases/tag/v3.24.0). (#14436)

### Changes for Developers

Note: this is an Add-on API compatibility breaking release.
Add-ons will need to be re-tested and have their manifest updated.
Please refer to [the developer guide](https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/developerGuide.html#API) for information on NVDA's API deprecation and removal process.

* System tests should now pass when run locally on non-English systems. (#13362)
* In Windows 11 on ARM, x64 apps are no longer identified as ARM64 applications. (#14403)
* It is no longer necessary to use `SearchField` and `SuggestionListItem` `UIA` `NVDAObjects` in new UI Automation scenarios, where automatic reporting of search suggestions, and where typing has been exposed via UI Automation with the `controllerFor` pattern.
This functionality is now available generically via `behaviours.EditableText` and the base `NVDAObject` respectively. (#14222)
* The UIA debug logging category when enabled now produces significantly more logging for UIA event handlers and utilities. (#14256)
* NVDAHelper build standards updated. (#13072)
  * Now uses the C++20 standard, was C++17.
  * Now uses the `/permissive-` compiler flag which disables permissive behaviors, and sets the `/Zc` compiler options for strict conformance.
* Some plugin objects (e.g. drivers and add-ons) now have a more informative description in the NVDA python console. (#14463)
* NVDA can now be fully compiled with Visual Studio 2022, no longer requiring the Visual Studio 2019 build tools. (#14326)
* More detailed logging for NVDA freezes to aid debugging. (#14309)
* The singleton `braille._BgThread` class has been replaced with `hwIo.ioThread.IoThread`. (#14130)
  * A single instance `hwIo.bgThread` (in NVDA core) of this class provides background i/o for thread safe braille display drivers.
  * This new class is not a singleton by design, add-on authors are encouraged to use their own instance when doing hardware i/o.
* The processor architecture for the computer can be queried from `winVersion.WinVersion.processorArchitecture attribute.` (#14439)
* New extension points have been added. (#14503)
  * `inputCore.decide_executeGesture`
  * `tones.decide_beep`
  * `nvwave.decide_playWaveFile`
  * `braille.pre_writeCells`
  * `braille.filter_displaySize`
  * `braille.decide_enabled`
  * `braille.displayChanged`
  * `braille.displaySizeChanged`
* It is possible to set useConfig to False on supported settings for a synthesizer driver. (#14601)

#### API Breaking Changes

These are breaking API changes.
Please open a GitHub issue if your Add-on has an issue with updating to the new API.

* The configuration specification has been altered, keys have been removed or modified:
  * In `[documentFormatting]` section (#14233):
    * `reportLineIndentation` stores an int value (0 to 3) instead of a boolean
    * `reportLineIndentationWithTones` has been removed.
    * `reportBorderStyle` and `reportBorderColor` have been removed and are replaced by `reportCellBorders`.
  * In `[braille]` section (#14233):
    * `noMessageTimeout` has been removed, replaced by a value for `showMessages`.
    * `messageTimeout` cannot take the value 0 anymore, replaced by a value for `showMessages`.
    * `autoTether` has been removed; `tetherTo` can now take the value "auto" instead.
  * In `[keyboard]` section  (#14528):
    * `useCapsLockAsNVDAModifierKey`, `useNumpadInsertAsNVDAModifierKey`, `useExtendedInsertAsNVDAModifierKey` have been removed.
    They are replaced by `NVDAModifierKeys`.
* The `NVDAHelper.RemoteLoader64` class has been removed with no replacement. (#14449)
* The following functions in `winAPI.sessionTracking` are removed with no replacement. (#14416, #14490)
  * `isWindowsLocked`
  * `handleSessionChange`
  * `unregister`
  * `register`
  * `isLockStateSuccessfullyTracked`
* It is no longer possible to enable/disable the braille handler by setting `braille.handler.enabled`.
To disable the braille handler programatically, register a handler to `braille.handler.decide_enabled`. (#14503)
* It is no longer possible to update the display size of the handler by setting `braille.handler.displaySize`.
To update the displaySize programatically, register a handler to `braille.handler.filter_displaySize`.
Refer to `brailleViewer` for an example on how to do this. (#14503)
* There have been changes to the usage of `addonHandler.Addon.loadModule`. (#14481)
  * `loadModule` now expects dot as a separator, rather than backslash.
  For example "lib.example" instead of "lib\example".
  * `loadModule` now raises an exception when a module can't be loaded or has errors, instead of silently returning `None` without giving information about the cause.
* The following symbols have been removed from `appModules.foobar2000` with no direct replacement. (#14570)
  * `statusBarTimes`
  * `parseIntervalToTimestamp`
  * `getOutputFormat`
  * `getParsingFormat`
* The following are no longer singletons - their get method has been removed.
Usage of `Example.get()` is now `Example()`. (#14248)
  * `UIAHandler.customAnnotations.CustomAnnotationTypesCommon`
  * `UIAHandler.customProps.CustomPropertiesCommon`
  * `NVDAObjects.UIA.excel.ExcelCustomProperties`
  * `NVDAObjects.UIA.excel.ExcelCustomAnnotationTypes`

#### Deprecations

* `NVDAObjects.UIA.winConsoleUIA.WinTerminalUIA` is deprecated and usage is discouraged. (#14047)

Use `configFlags.TetherTo.*.value` instead. (#14233)
* `utils.security.postSessionLockStateChanged` is deprecated.
Use `utils.security.post_sessionLockStateChanged` instead. (#14486)
* `NVDAObject.hasDetails`, `NVDAObject.detailsSummary`, `NVDAObject.detailsRole` has been deprecated.
Use `NVDAObject.annotations` instead. (#14507)
* `keyboardHandler.SUPPORTED_NVDA_MODIFIER_KEYS` is deprecated with no direct replacement.
Consider using the class `config.configFlags.NVDAKey` instead. (#14528)
* `gui.MainFrame.evaluateUpdatePendingUpdateMenuItemCommand` has been deprecated.
Use `gui.MainFrame.SysTrayIcon.evaluateUpdatePendingUpdateMenuItemCommand` instead. (#14523)

## 2022.3

Velikom dijelu ove inačice je doprinijela zajednica NVDA doprinositelja.
Ovo uključuje opise znakove poslije slovkanja i unapređenu podršku Windowsovog naredbenog redka.

Ova inačica uključuje nekoliko ispravaka grešaka.
Primjetno, posljednje inačice Adobe Acrobata/Readera neće se rušiti prilikom čitanja pdf dokumenta.

eSpeak je nadograđen, što znaći da su dodana tri nova jezika: bjeloruski, Luksenburški i Totontepec Mixe.

### Nove značajke

* U hostu Windows naredbenog redka kojeg koristi naredbeni redak, PowerShell i windows podsustav za sustava Linux u Windowsima 11 inačica 22H2 (Sun Valley 2) i novijim:
  * značajno su unapređene performanse i stabilnost. (#10964)
  * Prilikom pritiska prečaca `ctrl+f` za traženje teksta, pozicija preglednog kursora će se obnoviti kako bi pregledni kursor pratio pronađeni pojam. (#11172)
  * Izgovor upisanog teksta koji se ne pojavljuje na zaslonu poput lozinki je podrazumjevano isključen.
Može se uključiti u panelu NVDA Naprednih postavki. (#11554)
  * Tekst koji se pomaknuo izvan zaslona može se pregledavati bez potrebe za pomicanjem prozora naredbenog redka. (#12669)
  * Detaljnije informacije o oblikovanju teksta su dostupne. ([microsoft/terminal PR 10336](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/pull/10336))
* Dodana je nova opcija za govor koja omogućuje čitanje opisa znaka poslije zadrške. (#13509)
* Dodana je nova brajična opcija koja regulira dali će pomicanje teksta na brajičnom redku naprijed ili nazad prekidati govor. (#2124)

### Izmjene

* eSpeak NG je nadograđen na inačicu 1.52-dev commit `9de65fcb`. (#13295)
  * Dodani jezici:
    * Bjeloruski
    * Luksenburški
    * Totontepec Mixe
* Prilikom korištenja UI Automation za pristup Microsoft Excel proračunskim tablicama, NVDA sada može izgovarati spojene ćelije. (#12843)
* Umjesto izgovora "sadrži detalje" uključen je tip detalja, gdje je to moguće, na primjer "sadrži komentar". (#13649)
* Veličina instalacije NVDA sada se prikazuje u odjeljku programi i funkcije operativnog sustava Windows. (#13909)

### Ispravke grešaka

* Adobe Acrobat / Reader 64 bitne inačice više se neće rušiti prilikom čitanja PDF dokumenata. (#12920)
  * Imajte na umu da je potrebna posljednja inačica Adobe/acrobat readera kako bi se izbjeglo rušenje.
* Mjere veličine fonta su od sada prevedene u  NVDA. (#13573)
* Ignorirani su događaji Java Access Bridge gdje se ne može pronaći uloga prozora za java aplikacije.
Ovo će unaprediti performanse za neke java aplikacije uključujući IntelliJ IDEA. (#13039)
* Izgovor označenih ćelija za LibreOffice Calc je točniji i ne rezultira rušenjem aplikacije Calc prilikom označavanja više ćelija. (#13232)
* Kada se pokreće od drugug korisnika, Microsoft Edge više nije nepristupačan. (#13032)
* Kada je dopojačanje brzine uključeno,, eSpeakova brzina ne pada u međuvrijednost između brzina 99% i 100%. (#13876)
* Ispravljena je greška koja je dozvoljavala dva otvorena dijaloška okvira ulaznih gesti.. (#13854)

### Changes for Developers

* Updated Comtypes to version 1.1.11. (#12953)
* In builds of Windows Console (`conhost.exe`) with an NVDA API level of 2 (`FORMATTED`) or greater, such as those included with Windows 11 version 22H2 (Sun Valley 2), UI Automation is now used by default. (#10964)
  * This can be overridden by changing the "Windows Console support" setting in NVDA's advanced settings panel.
  * To find your Windows Console's NVDA API level, set "Windows Console support" to "UIA when available", then check the NVDA+F1 log opened from a running Windows Console instance.
* The Chromium virtual buffer is now loaded even when the document object has the MSAA `STATE_SYSTEM_BUSY` exposed via IA2. (#13306)
* A config spec type `featureFlag` has been created for use with experimental features in NVDA. See `devDocs/featureFlag.md` for more information. (#13859)

### Changes for Developers

* Note: this is an Add-on API compatibility breaking release. Add-ons will need to be re-tested and have their manifest updated.
* NVDA's build system now fetches all Python dependencies with pip and stores them in a Python virtual environment. This is all done transparently.
  * To build NVDA, SCons should continue to be used in the usual way. E.g. executing scons.bat in the root of the repository. Running `py -m SCons` is no longer supported, and `scons.py` has also been removed.
  * To run NVDA from source, rather than executing `source/nvda.pyw` directly, the developer should now use `runnvda.bat` in the root of the repository. If you do try to execute `source/nvda.pyw`, a message box will alert you this is no longer supported.
  * To perform unit tests, execute `rununittests.bat [<extra unittest discover options>]`
  * To perform system tests: execute `runsystemtests.bat [<extra robot options>]`
  * To perform linting, execute `runlint.bat <base branch>`
  * Please refer to readme.md for more details.
* The following Python dependencies have also been upgraded:
  * comtypes updated to 1.1.8.
  * pySerial updated to 3.5.
  * wxPython updated to 4.1.1.
  * Py2exe updated to 0.10.1.0.

  * To alter the diff behaviour for some object, override the `diffAlgo` property (see the docstring for details).
* When defining a script with the script decorator, the 'allowInSleepMode' boolean argument can be specified to control if a script is available in sleep mode or not. (#11979)
* The following functions are removed from the config module. (#11935)
  * canStartOnSecureScreens - use config.isInstalledCopy instead.
  * hasUiAccess and execElevated - use them from the systemUtils module.
  * getConfigDirs - use globalVars.appArgs.configPath instead.
* Module level REASON_* constants are removed from controlTypes - please use controlTypes.OutputReason instead. (#11969)
* REASON_QUICKNAV has been removed from browseMode - use controlTypes.OutputReason.QUICKNAV instead. (#11969)
* `NVDAObject` (and derivatives) property `isCurrent` now strictly returns Enum class `controlTypes.IsCurrent`. (#11782)
  * `isCurrent` is no longer Optional, and thus will not return None.
    * When an object is not current `controlTypes.IsCurrent.NO` is returned.
* The `controlTypes.isCurrentLabels` mapping has been removed. (#11782)
  * Instead use the `displayString` property on a `controlTypes.IsCurrent` enum value.
    * For example: `controlTypes.IsCurrent.YES.displayString`.
* `winKernel.GetTimeFormat` has been removed - use `winKernel.GetTimeFormatEx` instead. (#12139)

* `speakTextInfo` will no longer send speech through `speakWithoutPauses` if reason is `SAYALL`, as `SayAllHandler` does this manually now. (#12150)
* The `synthDriverHandler` module is no longer star imported into `globalCommands` and `gui.settingsDialogs` - use `from synthDriverHandler import synthFunctionExample` instead. (#12172)
* `ROLE_EQUATION` has been removed from controlTypes - use `ROLE_MATH` instead. (#12164)
* `autoSettingsUtils.driverSetting` classes are removed from `driverHandler` - please use them from `autoSettingsUtils.driverSetting`. (#12168)

  * Function winVersion.getWinVer has been added to get a winVersion.WinVersion representing the currently running OS.
  * Convenience constants have been added for known Windows releases, see winVersion.WIN* constants.
* IAccessibleHandler no longer star imports everything from IAccessible and IA2 COM interfaces - please use them directly. (#12232)
* TextInfo objects now have start and end properties which can be compared mathematically with operators such as < <= == != >= >. (#11613)
  * E.g. ti1.start <= ti2.end
  * This usage is now prefered instead of ti1.compareEndPoints(ti2,"startToEnd") <= 0
* TextInfo start and end properties can also be set to each other. (#11613)
  * E.g. ti1.start = ti2.end
  * This usage is prefered instead of ti1.SetEndPoint(ti2,"startToEnd")
* `wx.CENTRE_ON_SCREEN` and `wx.CENTER_ON_SCREEN` are removed, use `self.CentreOnScreen()` instead. (#12309)

  * `speech.speechMode_beeps` becomes `speech.SpeechMode.beeps`
  * `speech.speechMode_talk` becomes `speech.SpeechMode.talk`
* `IAccessibleHandler.IAccessibleObjectIdentifierType` is now `IAccessibleHandler.types.IAccessibleObjectIdentifierType`. (#12367)

## 2019.1

Highlights of this release include performance improvements when accessing both Microsoft word and Excel, stability and security improvements such as support for add-ons with version compatibility information, and many other bug fixes.

Please note that starting from this release of NVDA, custom appModules, globalPlugins, braille display drivers and synth drivers will no longer be automatically loaded from your NVDA user configuration directory. 
Rather these  should be installed as part of an NVDA add-on. For those developing code for an add-on, code for testing can be placed in a new developer scratchpad directory in the NVDA user configuration directory,  if the Developer scratchpad option  is turned on in NVDA's new Advanced settings panel.
These changes are necessary to better ensure compatibility of custom code, so that NVDA does not break when this code becomes incompatible with newer releases.
Please refer to the list of changes further down for more details on this and how add-ons are now better versioned.

### New Features

* New braille tables: Afrikaans, Arabic 8 dot computer braille, Arabic grade 2, Spanish grade 2. (#4435, #9186)
* Added an option to NVDA's mouse settings to make NVDA handle situations where the mouse is controlled by another application. (#8452) 
 * This will allow NVDA to track the mouse when a system is controlled remotely using TeamViewer or other remote control software.
* Added the `--enable-start-on-logon` command line parameter to allow configuring whether silent installations of NVDA set NVDA to start at Windows logon or not. Specify true to start at logon or false to not start at logon. If the --enable-start-on-logon argument is not specified at all then NVDA will default to starting at logon, unless it was  already configured not to by a previous installation. (#8574)
* It is possible to turn NVDA's logging features off by setting logging level to "disabled" from General settings panel. (#8516)
* The presence of formulae in LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice spreadsheets is now reported. (#860)
* In Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, browse mode now reports the selected item in list boxes and trees.
 * This works in Firefox 66 and later.
 * This does not work for certain list boxes (HTML select controls) in Chrome.
* Early support for apps such as Mozilla Firefox on computers with ARM64 (e.g. Qualcomm Snapdragon) processors. (#9216)
* A new Advanced Settings category has been added to NVDA's Settings dialog, including an option to try out NVDA's new support for Microsoft Word via the Microsoft UI Automation API. (#9200)
* Added support for the graphical view in Windows Disk Management. (#1486)
* Added support for Handy Tech Connect Braille and Basic Braille 84. (#9249)

### Changes

* Updated liblouis braille translator to version 3.8.0. (#9013)
* Add-on authors now can enforce a minimum required NVDA version for their add-ons. NVDA will refuse to install or load an add-on whose minimum required NVDA version is higher than the current NVDA version. (#6275)
* Add-on authors can now specify the last version of NVDA the add-on has been tested against. If an add-on has been only tested against a  version of NVDA lower than the current version, then NVDA will refuse to install or load the add-on. (#6275)
* This version of NVDA will allow installing and loading of add-ons  that do not yet contain Minimum and Last Tested NVDA version information, but upgrading to future versions of NVDA (E.g. 2019.2) may automatically cause these older add-ons to be disabled.
* The move mouse to navigator object command is now available in Microsoft Word as well as for UIA controls, particularly Microsoft Edge. (#7916, #8371)
* Reporting of text under the mouse has been improved within Microsoft Edge and other UIA applications. (#8370)
* When NVDA is started with the `--portable-path` command line parameter, the provided path is automatically filled in when trying to create a portable copy of NVDA using the NVDA menu. (#8623)
* Updated the path to the Norwegian braille table to reflect the standard from the year 2015. (#9170)
* When navigating by paragraph (control+up or down arrows) or navigating by table cell (control+alt+arrows), the existence of spelling errors will no longer be announced, even if NVDA is configured to announce these automatically. This is because paragraphs and table cells can be quite large, and detecting spelling errors in some applications can be very costly. (#9217)
* NVDA no longer automatically loads custom appModules, globalPlugins and braille and synth drivers from the NVDA user configuration directory. This code should be instead packaged as an add-on with correct version information, ensuring that incompatible code is not run with current versions of NVDA. (#9238)
 * For developers who need to test code as it is being developed,  enable NVDA's developer scratchpad directory in the Advanced category of NVDA settings, and place your code in the 'scratchpad' directory found in the NVDA user configuration directory when this option is enabled.

### Bug Fixes

* When using OneCore speech synthesizer on Windows 10 April 2018 Update and later, large chunks of silence are no longer inserted between speech utterances. (#8985)

* Responsiveness in Microsoft Word when navigating by line, paragraph or table cell may be significantly improved in some documents. A reminder that for best performance, set Microsoft Word to Draft view with alt+w,e after opening a document. (#9217) 
* In Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, empty alerts are no longer reported. (#5657)
* Significant performance improvements when navigating cells in Microsoft Excel, particularly when the spreadsheet contains comments and or validation dropdown lists. (#7348)
* It should be no longer necessary to turn off in-cell editing in Microsoft Excel's options to access the cell edit control with NVDA in Excel 2016/365. (#8146).
* Fixed a freeze in Firefox sometimes seen when quick navigating by landmarks, if the Enhanced Aria add-on is in use. (#8980)

* For document implementations such as NVDAObjects or browseMode that have a textInfo, there is now a new documentBase.documentWithTableNavigation class that can be inherited from to gain standard table navigation scripts. Please refer to this class to see which helper methods must be provided by your implementation for table navigation to work. (#7849)
* The scons batch file now better handles when  Python 3 is also installed, making use of the launcher to specifically launch python 2.7 32 bit. (#7541)
* hwIo.Hid now takes an additional parameter exclusive, which defaults to True. If set to False, other applications are allowed to communicate with a device while it is connected to NVDA. (#7859)

* Fixed some other rare selection problems in browse mode. (#7131)

### Changes for Developers

* Commandline arguments are now processed with Python's argparse module, rather than optparse. This allows certain options such as -r and -q to be handled exclusively. (#6865)
* core.callLater now queues the callback to NVDA's main queue after the given delay, rather than waking the core and executing it directly. This stops possible freezes due to the  core accidentally going to sleep after processing a callback, in the midle of  a modal call such as the desplaying of a message box. (#6797)
* The InputGesture.identifiers property has been changed so that it is no longer normalized. (#6945)
 * Subclasses no longer need to normalize identifiers before returning them from this property.
 * If you want normalized identifiers, there is now an InputGesture.normalizedIdentifiers property which normalizes the identifiers returned by the identifiers property .
* The InputGesture.logIdentifier property is now deprecated. Callers should use InputGesture.identifiers[0] instead. (#6945)
* Removed some deprecated code:
 * `speech.REASON_*` constants: `controlTypes.REASON_*` should be used instead. (#6846)
 * `i18nName` for synth settings: `displayName` and `displayNameWithAccelerator` should be used instead. (#6846, #5185)
 * `config.validateConfig`. (#6846, #667)
 * `config.save`: `config.conf.save` should be used instead. (#6846, #667)
* The list of completions in the autocomplete context menu of the Python Console no longer shows  any object path leading up to the final symbol being completed. (#7023)
* There is now a unit testing framework for NVDA. (#7026)
 * Unit tests and infrastructure are located in the tests/unit directory. See the docstring in the tests\unit\init.py file for details.
 * You can run tests using "scons tests". See the "Running Tests" section of readme.md for details.
 * If you are submitting a pull request for NVDA, you should first run the tests and ensure they pass.

* Updated eSpeak NG (commit e095f008, 10 January 2017). (#6717)
* Due to changes In the Windows 10 Creators Update, the "Always duck" mode is no longer available in NVDA's Audio ducking settings. It is still available on older windows 10 releases. (#6684)
* Due to changes in the  Windows 10 Creators Update, the "Duck when outputting speech and sounds" mode can no longer ensure audio has ducked fully before starting to speak, nor will it keep audio ducked long enough after speaking to stop rappid bouncing in volume.

* In Spotify, focus no longer frequently lands on "unknown" objects. (#5439)
* Focus is now restored correctly when returning to Spotify from another application. (#5439)
* When toggling between browse mode and focus mode, the mode is reported in braille as well as speech. (#5239)

* NVDA no longer silently exits when closing a Windows command console with alt+f4 in Windows 10. (#5343)
* In the Elements List in browse mode, when you change the type of element, the Filter by field is now cleared. (#5511)
* In editable text in Mozilla applications, moving the mouse again reads the appropriate line, word, etc. as expected instead of the entire content. (#5535)
* When moving the mouse in editable text in Mozilla applications, reading no longer stops at elements such as links within the word or line being read. (#2160, #5535)
* In Internet Explorer, the shoprite.com website can now be read in browse mode instead of reporting as blank. (Specifically, malformed lang attributes are now handled gracefully.) (#5569)

### Changes for Developers

* The new audioDucking.AudioDucker class allows code which outputs audio to indicate when background audio should be ducked. (#3830)
* nvwave.WavePlayer's constructor now has a wantDucking keyword argument which specifies whether background audio should be ducked while audio is playing. (#3830)
 * When this is enabled (which is the default), it is essential that WavePlayer.idle be called when appropriate.
* Enhanced I/O for braille displays: (#5609)
 * Thread-safe braille display drivers can declare themselves as such using the BrailleDisplayDriver.isThreadSafe attribute. A driver must be thread-safe to benefit from the following features.
 * Data is written to thread-safe braille display drivers in the background, thus improving performance.
 * hwIo.Serial extends pyserial to call a callable when data is received instead of drivers having to poll.
 * hwIo.Hid provides support for braille displays communicating via USB HID.
 * hwPortUtils and hwIo can optionally provide detailed debug logging, including devices found and all data sent and received.
* There are several new properties accessible from touch screen gestures: (#5652)
 * MultitouchTracker objects now contain a childTrackers property which contains the MultiTouchTrackers the tracker was composed of. For example, 2 finger double tap has child trackers for two 2-finger taps. The 2-finger taps themselves have child trackers for two taps.
 * MultiTouchTracker objects now also contain a rawSingleTouchTracker property if the tracker was the result of one single finger doing a tap, flick or hover. The SingleTouchTracker allows access to the underlying ID assigned to the finger by the operating system and whether or not the finger is still in contact at the current time.
 * TouchInputGestures now have x and y properties, removing the need to access the tracker for trivial cases.
 * TouchInputGesturs now contain a preheldTracker property, which is a MultitouchTracker object representing the other fingers held while this action was being performed.
* Two new touch screen gestures can be emitted: (#5652)
 * Plural tap and holds (e.g. double tap and hold)
 * A generalized identifier with finger count removed for holds (e.g. hold+hover for 1finger_hold+hover).

## 2015.4

Highlights of this release include performance improvements in Windows 10; inclusion in the Ease of Access Center in Windows 8 and later; enhancements for Microsoft Excel, including listing and renaming of sheets and access to locked cells in protected sheets; and support for editing of rich text in Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Mozilla Thunderbird.

* In PowerPoint slide shows, the review cursor correctly follows the virtual caret. (#4370)
* In Mozilla Firefox and other Gecko-based browsers, new content within a live region will be announced even if the new content has a usable ARIA live type different to the parent live region; e.g. when content marked as assertive is added to a live region marked as polite. (#4169)
* In Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls, some cases where a document is contained within another document no longer prevent the user from accessing some of the content (specifically, framesets inside framesets). (#4418)

* When using a Papenmeier BRAILLEX braille display with BrxCom, keys on the display now work as expected. (#4614)

### Changes for Developers

* For executables which host many different apps (e.g. javaw.exe), code can now be provided to load specific app modules for each app instead of loading the same app module for all hosted apps. (#4360)
 * See the code documentation for appModuleHandler.AppModule for details.

* In browse mode in web browsers, certain graphics that are explicitly marked as presentational (specifically, with an alt="" attribute) are now correctly ignored.
* In web browsers, NVDA now hides content which is marked as hidden from screen readers (specifically, using the aria-hidden attribute). (#2117)
* Negative currency amounts (e.g. -$123) are now correctly spoken as negative, regardless of symbol level. (#2625)
* During say all, NVDA will no longer incorrectly revert to the default language where a line does not end a sentence. (#2630)
* Font information is now correctly detected in Adobe Reader 10.1 and later. (#2175)
* In Adobe Reader, if alternate text is provided, only that text will be rendered. Previously, extraneous text was sometimes included. (#2174)
* Where a document contains an application, the content of the application is no longer included in browse mode. This prevents unexpectedly moving inside the application when navigating. You can interact with the application in the same way as for embedded objects. (#990)
* In Mozilla applications, the value of spin buttons is now correctly reported when it changes. (#2653)
* Updated support for Adobe Digital Editions so that it works in version 2.0. (#2688)

* Previous log file is now copied to nvda-old.log on NVDA initialization. Therefore, if NVDA crashes or is restarted, logging information from that session is still accessible for inspection. (#916)
* Fetching the role property in chooseNVDAObjectOverlayClasses no longer causes the role to be incorrect and thus not reported on focus for certain objects such as Windows command consoles and Scintilla controls. (#2569)
* The NVDA Preferences, Tools and Help menus are now accessible as attributes on gui.mainFrame.sysTrayIcon named preferencesMenu, toolsMenu and helpMenu, respectively. This allows plugins to more easily add items to these menus.
* The navigatorObject_doDefaultAction script in globalCommands has been renamed to review_activate.
* Gettext message contexts are now supported. This allows multiple translations to be defined for a single English message depending on the context. (#1524)
 * This is done using the pgettext(context, message) function.
 * This is supported for both NVDA itself and add-ons.
 * xgettext and msgfmt from GNU gettext must be used to create any PO and MO files. The Python tools do not support message contexts.

 * See http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Contexts.html#Contexts for more information.
* It is now possible to access built-in NVDA modules where they have been overridden by third party modules. See the nvdaBuiltin module for details.
* Add-on translation support can now be used within the add-on installTasks module. (#2715)

## 2012.2.1

This release addresses  several potential security issues (by upgrading Python to 2.7.3).

## 2012.2

Highlights of this release include an in-built installer and  portable  creation feature, automatic updates, easy management of new NVDA add-ons, announcement of graphics in Microsoft Word, support for Windows 8 Metro style apps, and several important bug fixes. 

### New Features

* NVDA can now automatically check for, download and install updates. (#73)
* Extending NVDA's functionality  has been made easier with the addition of an Add-ons Manager (found under Tools in the NVDA menu) allowing you to install and uninstall new NVDA add-on packages (.nvda-addon files) containing plugins and drivers. Note the Add-on manager does not show older custom plugins and drivers manually copied in to your configuration directory. (#213)
* Many more common NVDA features now work in Windows 8 Metro style apps when using an installed release  of NVDA, including speaking of typed characters, and browse mode for web documents (includes support for metro version of Internet Explorer 10). Portable copies of NVDA cannot access metro style apps. (#1801) 
* In browse mode documents (Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc.), you can now  jump to the start and past the end of certain containing elements (such as lists and tables) with shift+, and , respectively. (#123)
* New language: Greek.
* Graphics and alt text are now reported in Microsoft Word Documents. (#2282, #1541)

### Changes

* Announcement of cell coordinates in Microsoft Excel is now after the content rather than before, and is now only included   if the report tables and report table cell coordinates settings are enabled in the Document formatting settings dialog. (#320)
* NVDA is now distributed in one package. Rather than separate portable and installer versions, there is now just one file that, when run, will start a temporary copy of NVDA and will allow you to install or generate a portable distribution. (#1715)
* NVDA is now always installed in to Program Files on all systems. Updating a previous install will also automatically move it if it was not previously installed there.

### Bug Fixes

* With auto language switching enabled, Content such as alt text for graphics and labels for other certain controls in Mozilla Gecko (e.g. Firefox) are now reported in the correct language if marked up appropriately.

* Lists found in the Windows 8 Explorer file properties (permitions tab) and in Windows 8 Windows Update now read correctly.
* Fixed possible freezes in MS Word which would result when it took more than 2 seconds to fetch text from a document (extremely long lines or tables of contents). (#2191)
* Detection of word breaks now works correctly where whitespace is followed by certain punctuation. (#1656)
* In browse mode in Adobe Reader, it is now possible to navigate to headings without a level using quick navigation and the Elements List. (#2181)
* In Winamp, braille is now correctly updated when you move to a different item in the Playlist Editor. (#1912)
* The tree in the Elements List (available for browse mode documents) is now properly sized to show  the text of each element. (#2276)
* In applications using the Java Access Bridge, editable text fields are now presented correctly in braille. (#2284)
* In applications using the java Access Bridge, editable text fields no longer report strange characters in certain circumstances. (#1892)
* In applications using the Java Access Bridge, when at the end of an editable text field, the current line is now reported correctly. (#1892)
* In browse mode in applications using Mozilla Gecko 14 and later (e.g. Firefox 14), quick navigation now works for block quotes and embedded objects. (#2287)
* In Internet Explorer 9, NVDA no longer reads unwanted content when focus moves inside certain landmarks or focusable elements (specifically, a div element which is focusable or has an ARIA landmark role).
* The NVDA icon for the NVDA Desktop and Start Menu shortcuts is now displayed correctly on 64 bit editions of Windows. (#354)

### Changes for Developers

* Due to the replacement of the previous NSIS installer for NVDA with a built-in installer in Python, it is no longer necessary for translaters to maintain a langstrings.txt file for the installer. All localization strings are now managed by gettext po files.

## 2012.1

Highlights of this release include features for more fluent reading of braille; indication of document formatting in braille; access to much more formatting information and improved performance in Microsoft Word; and support for the iTunes Store.

### New Features

* NVDA can announce the number of leading tabs and spaces of the current line in the order that they are entered. This can be enabled by selecting report line indentation in the document formatting dialogue. (#373)
* NVDA can now detect key presses generated from alternative keyboard input emulation such as on-screen keyboards and speech recognition software.
* NVDA can now detect colors in Windows command consoles.
* Bold, italic and underline are now indicated in braille using signs appropriate to the configured translation table. (#538)

 * Reporting when entering document sections such as the comments story, footnotes and endnotes stories, and header and footer stories.
* Braille now indicates selected text using dots 7 and 8. (#889)
* Braille now reports information about controls within documents such as links, buttons and headings. (#202)
* Support for the hedo ProfiLine and MobilLine USB braille displays. (#1863, #1897)
* NVDA now avoids splitting words in braille when possible by default. This can be disabled in the Braille Settings dialog. (#1890, #1946)
* It is now possible to have braille displayed by paragraphs instead of lines, which may allow for more fluent reading of large amounts of text. This is configurable using the Read by paragraphs option in the Braille Settings dialog. (#1891)
* In browse mode, you can activate the object under the cursor using a braille display. This is done by pressing the cursor routing key where the cursor is located (which means pressing it twice if the cursor is not already there). (#1893)
* Basic support for web areas in iTunes such as the Store. Other applications using WebKit 1 may also be supported. (#734)
* In books in Adobe Digital Editions 1.8.1 and later, pages are now turned automatically when using say all. (#1978)
* New braille translation tables: Portuguese grade 2, Icelandic 8 dot computer braille, Tamil grade 1, Spanish 8 dot computer braille, Farsi grade 1. (#2014)

* Updated eSpeak speech synthesizer to 1.46.02.
* NVDA will now truncate extremely long (30 characters or greater) names guessed from graphic and link URLs as they are most likely garbage that gets in the way of reading. (#1989)
* Some information displayed in braille has been abbreviated. (#1955, #2043)
* When the caret or review cursor moves, braille is now scrolled in the same way as when it is manually scrolled. This makes it more appropriate when braille is configured to read by paragraphs and/or avoid splitting words. (#1996)
* Updated to new Spanish grade 1 braille translation table.
* Updated liblouis braille translator to 2.4.1.

### Bug Fixes

* In Windows 8, focus is no longer incorrectly moved away from the Windows Explorer search field, which was not allowing NVDA to interact with it.
* Major performance improvements when reading and navigating Microsoft Word documents while automatic reporting of formatting is enabled, thus now making it quite comfortable to proof read formatting etc. Performance may be also improved over all for some users.
* Browse mode is now used for full screen Adobe Flash content.
* Fixed poor audio quality in some cases when using Microsoft Speech API version 5 voices with the audio output device set to something other than the default (Microsoft Sound Mapper). (#749)
* Again allow NVDA to be used with the "no speech" synthesizer, relying purely on braille or the speech viewer. (#1963)
* Object navigation commands no longer report "No children" and "No parents", but instead report messages consistent with the documentation.
* When NVDA is configured to use a language other than English, the name of the tab key is now reported in the correct language.
* In Mozilla Gecko (e.g. Firefox), NVDA no longer intermittently switches to browse mode while navigating menus in documents. (#2025)
* In Calculator, the backspace key now reports the updated result instead of reporting nothing. (#2030)
* In browse mode, the move mouse to current navigator object command now routes to the center of the object at the review cursor instead of the top left, making it more accurate it some cases. (#2029)
* In browse mode with automatic focus mode for focus changes enabled, focusing on a toolbar will now switch to focus mode. (#1339)
* The report title command works correctly again in Adobe Reader.
* With automatic focus mode for focus changes enabled, focus mode is now correctly used for focused table cells; e.g. in ARIA grids. (#1763)
* In iTunes, position information in certain lists is now reported correctly.
* In Adobe Reader, some links are no longer treated as containing read-only editable text fields.
* The labels of some editable text fields are no longer incorrectly included when reporting the text of a dialog. (#1960)
* The description of groupings is once again reported if reporting of object descriptions is enabled.
* The human readable sizes are now included in the text of the Windows Explorer drive properties dialog.
* Double reporting of property page text has been suppressed in some cases. (#218)
* Improved tracking of the caret in editable text fields which rely on text written to the screen. In particular, this improves editing in the Microsoft Excel cell editor and the Eudora message editor. (#1658)
* In Firefox 11, the move to containing virtual buffer command (NVDA+control+space) now works as it should to escape embedded objects such as Flash content.
* NVDA now restarts itself correctly (e.g. after changing the configured language) when it is located in a directory which contains non-ASCII characters. (#2079)
* Braille correctly respects the settings for reporting of object shortcut keys, position information and descriptions.
* In Mozilla applications, switching between browse and focus modes is no longer slow with braille enabled. (#2095)
* Routing the cursor to the space at the end of the line/paragraph using braille cursor routing keys in some editable text fields now works correctly instead of routing to the start of the text. (#2096)
* NVDA again works correctly with the Audiologic Tts3 synthesizer. (#2109)
* Microsoft Word documents are correctly treated as multi-line. This causes braille to behave more appropriately when a document is focused.
* In Microsoft Internet Explorer, errors no longer occur when focusing on certain rare controls. (#2121)
* Changing the pronunciation of punctuation/symbols by the user will now take effect straight away, rather than requiring NVDA to be restarted or auto language switching to be disabled.
* When using eSpeak, speech no longer goes silent in some cases in the Save As dialog of the NVDA Log Viewer. (#2145)

### Changes for Developers

* There is now a remote Python console for situations where remote debugging is useful. See the Developer Guide for details.
* The base path of NVDA's code is now stripped from tracebacks in the log to improve readability. (#1880)
* TextInfo objects now have an activate() method to activate the position represented by the TextInfo.
 * This is used by braille to activate the position using cursor routing keys on a braille display. However, there may be other callers in future.
* TreeInterceptors and NVDAObjects which only expose one page of text at a time can support automatic page turns during say all by using the textInfos.DocumentWithPageTurns mix-in. (#1978)
* Several control and output constants have been renamed or moved. (#228)
 * speech.REASON_* constants have been moved to controlTypes.
 * In controlTypes, speechRoleLabels and speechStateLabels have been renamed to just roleLabels and stateLabels, respectively.
* Braille output is now logged at level input/output. First, the untranslated text of all regions is logged, followed by the braille cells of the window being displayed. (#2102)
* subclasses of the sapi5 synthDriver can now override _getVoiceTokens and extend init to support custom voice tokens such as with sapi.spObjectTokenCategory to get tokens from a custom registry location.

## 2011.3

* Automatic say all when a browse mode document loads is now optional via a setting in the Browse Mode settings dialog. (#414)  
* When trying to read the status bar (Desktop NVDA+end), If a real status bar object cannot be located, NVDA will instead resort to using the bottom line of text written to the display for the active application. (#649)
* When reading with say all in browse mode documents, NVDA will now pause at the end of headings and other block-level elements, rather than speaking the text together with the next lot of text as one long sentence.
* In browse mode, pressing enter or space on a tab now activates it instead of switching to focus mode. (#1760)
* Updated eSpeak speech synthesizer to 1.45.47.

### Bug Fixes

* NVDA  no longer shows bullets or numbering for lists in Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls when the author has indicated that these should not be shown (i.e. the list style is "none"). (#1671)
* Restarting NVDA when it has frozen (e.g. by pressing control+alt+n) no longer exits the previous copy without starting a new one.
* Pressing backspace or arrow keys in a Windows command console no longer causes strange results in some cases. (#1612)
* The selected item in WPF combo boxes (and possibly some other combo boxes exposed using UI Automation) which do not allow text editing is now reported correctly.
* In browse mode in Adobe Reader, it is now always possible to move to the next row from the header row and vice versa using the move to next row and move to previous row commands. Also, the header row is no longer reported as row 0. (#1731)
* In browse mode in Adobe Reader, it is now possible to move to (and therefore past) empty cells in a table.
* Pointless position information (e.g. 0 of 0 level 0) is no longer reported in braille.
* When braille is tethered to review, it is now able to show  content in flat review. (#1711)
* A text control's text is no longer presented twice on a braille display in some cases, e.g. scrolling back from the start of Wordpad documents.
* In browse mode in Internet Explorer, pressing enter on a file upload button now correctly presents the dialog to choose a file to upload instead of switching to focus mode. (#1720)
* Dynamic content changes such as in Dos consoles are no longer announced if  sleep mode for that application is currently on. (#1662)
* In browse mode, the behaviour of alt+upArrow and alt+downArrow to collapse and expand combo boxes has been improved. (#1630)
* NVDA now recovers from many more situations such as applications that stop responding which previously caused it to freeze completely. (#1408)
* For Mozilla Gecko (Firefox etc) browse mode documents NVDA will no longer fail to render text in a very specific situation where an element is styled as display:table. (#1373)
* NVDA will no longer announce label controls when focus moves inside of them. Stops double announcements of labels for some form fields in Firefox (Gecko) and Internet Explorer (MSHTML). (#1650)
* NVDA no longer fails to read a cell in Microsoft Excel after pasting in to it with control+v. (#1781)
* In Adobe Reader, extraneous information about the document is no longer announced when moving to a control on a different page in focus mode. (#1659)

### Changes for Developers

* NVDA can now instruct speech synthesizers to switch languages for particular sections of speech.
 * To support this, drivers must handle speech.LangChangeCommand in sequences past to SynthDriver.speak().
 * SynthDriver objects should also provide the language argument to VoiceInfo objects (or override the language attribute to retrieve the current language). Otherwise, NVDA's user interface language will be used.

## 2011.2

Highlights of this release include major improvements concerning punctuation and symbols, including configurable levels, custom labelling and character descriptions; no pauses at the end of lines during say all; improved support for ARIA in Internet Explorer; better support for XFA/LiveCycle PDF documents in Adobe Reader; access to text written to the screen in more applications; and access to formatting and color information for text written to the screen.

### New Features

* It is now possible to hear the description for any given character by pressing the review current character script twice in quick succession.  For English characters this is the standard English phonetic alphabet. For pictographic languages such as traditional Chinese, one or more example phrases using the given symbol are provided. Also pressing review current word or review current line three times will spell the word/line using the first of these descriptions. (#55)
* More text can be seen in flat review for applications such as Mozilla Thunderbird that write their text directly to the display as glyphs.
* It is now possible to choose from several levels of punctuation and symbol announcement. (#332)
* When punctuation or other symbols are repeated more than four times, the number of repetitions is now announced instead of speaking the repeated symbols. (#43)
* New braille translation tables: Norwegian 8 dot computer braille, Ethiopic grade 1, Slovene grade 1, Serbian grade 1. (#1456)
* Speech no longer unnaturally pauses at the end of each line when using the say all command. (#149)

* Unicode Braille Patterns are now displayed correctly on braille displays. (#1505)
* In Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls when focus moves inside a group of controls (surrounded by a fieldset), NVDA will now announce the name of the group (the legend). (#535)
* In Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls, the aria-labelledBy and aria-describedBy properties are now honoured.
* in Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls, support for ARIA list, gridcell, slider and progressbar controls has been improved.
* Users can now change the pronunciation of punctuation and other symbols, as well as the symbol level at which they are spoken. (#271, #1516)
* In Microsoft Excel, the name of the active sheet is now reported when switching sheets with control+pageUp or control+pageDown. (#760)
* When navigating a table in Microsoft Word with the tab key NVDA will now announce the current cell as you move. (#159)
* You can now configure whether table cell coordinates are reported from the Document Formatting preferences dialog. (#719)
* NVDA can now detect formatting and color for text written to the screen.
* In the Outlook Express/Windows Mail/Windows Live Mail message list, NVDA will now announce the fact that a message is unread and also if it's expanded or collapsed in the case of conversation threads. (#868)
* eSpeak now has a rate boost setting which triples the speaking rate.
* Support for the  calendar control found in the Date and Time Information dialog accessed from the  Windows 7 clock. (#1637)
* Additional key bindings have been added for the MDV Lilli braille display. (#241)
* New languages: Bulgarian, Albanian.

### Changes

* To move the caret to the review cursor, now press the move focus to navigator object script (desktop NVDA+shift+numpadMinus, laptop NVDA+shift+backspace) twice in quick succession. This frees up more keys on the keyboard. (#837)
* To hear the  decimal and hexadecimal representation of the character under the review cursor, now press review current character three times rather than twice, as twice now speaks the character description.
* Updated eSpeak speech synthesiser to 1.45.03. (#1465)
* Layout tables are no longer announced in Mozilla Gecko applications while moving the focus when in focus mode or outside of a document.
* In Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls, browse mode now works for documents inside ARIA applications. (#1452)
* Updated liblouis braille translator to 2.3.0.
* When in browse mode  and jumping to a control with quicknav or focus, the description of the control is now announced if it has one.
* Progress bars are now announced in brows mode.
* Nodes marked with an ARIA role of presentation in Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls are now filtered out of simple review and the focus ancestry.
* NVDA's user interface and documentation now refer to virtual buffers as browse mode, as the term "virtual buffer" is rather meaningless to most users. (#1509)
* When the user wishes to copy their user settings to the system profile for use on the logon screen, etc., and their settings contain custom plugins, they are now warned that this could be a security risk. (#1426)
* The NVDA service no longer starts and stops NVDA on user input desktops.
* On Windows XP and Windows Vista, NVDA no longer makes use of UI Automation even if it is available via the platform update. Although using UI Automation can improve the accessibility of some modern applications, on XP and Vista there were too many freezes, crashes and over all performance loss while using it. (#1437)
* In applications using Mozilla Gecko 2 and later (such as Firefox 4 and later), a document can now be read in browse mode before it is fully finished loading.
* NVDA now announces the state of a container when focus moves to a control inside it (e.g. if focus moves inside a document that is still loading it will report it as busy).
* NVDA's user interface and documentation no longer use the terms "first child" and "parent" with respect to object navigation, as these terms are confusing for many users.
* Collapsed is no longer reported for some menu items which have sub-menus.
* The reportCurrentFormatting script (NVDA+f) now reports the formatting at the position of the review cursor rather than the system caret / focus. As  by default the review cursor follows the caret, most people should not notice a difference. However this now enables the user to find out the formatting when moving the review cursor, such as in flat review.

### Bug Fixes

* Collapsing combo boxes in browse mode documents when focus mode has been forced with NVDA+space no longer auto-switches back to browse mode. (#1386)

* When Braille is tethered to review and the navigator object is moved to a browse mode document, either manually or due to a focus change, braille will appropriately show the browse mode content. (#1406, #1407)
* When speaking of punctuation is disabled, certain punctuation is no longer incorrectly spoken when using some synthesisers. (#332)
* Problems no longer occur when loading configuration for synthesisers which do not support the voice setting such as Audiologic Tts3. (#1347)

* NVDA now Appropriately honours the aria-selected attribute in Internet Explorer documents.
* When NVDA automatically switches to focus mode in browse mode documents, it now announces information about the context of the focus. For example, if a list box item receives focus, the list box will be announced first. (#1491)

* In browse mode documents, NVDA no longer incorrectly switches out of focus mode when aria-activedescendant is set; e.g. when the completion list appeared in some auto complete controls.
* In Adobe Reader, the name of controls is now reported when moving focus or using quick navigation in browse mode.
* In XFA PDF documents in Adobe Reader, buttons, links and graphics are now rendered correctly.
* In XFA PDF documents in Adobe Reader, all elements are now rendered on separate lines. This change was made because large sections (sometimes even the entire document) were being rendered without breaks due to the general lack of structure in these documents.
* Fixed problems when moving focus to or away from editable text fields in XFA PDF documents in Adobe Reader.
* In XFA PDF documents in Adobe Reader, changes to the value of a focused combo box will now be reported.
* Owner-drawn Combo boxes such as the ones to choose colors in Outlook Express are now accessible with NVDA. (#1340)
* In languages which use a space as a digit group/thousands separator such as French and German, numbers from separate chunks of text are no longer pronounced as a single number. This was particularly problematic for table cells containing numbers. (#555)
* nodes with an ARIA role of description in Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls now are classed as static text, not edit fields.
* Fixed various issues when pressing tab while focus is on a document in browse mode (e.g. tab inappropriately moving to the address bar in Internet Explorer). (#720, #1367)
* When entering lists while reading text, NVDA now says, for example, "list with 5 items" instead of "listwith 5 items". (#1515)
* In input help mode, gestures are logged even if their scripts bypass input help such as the scroll braille display forward and back commands.
* In input help mode, when a modifier is held down on the keyboard, NVDA no longer reports the modifier as if it is modifying itself; e.g. NVDA+NVDA.
* In Adobe Reader documents, pressing c or shift+c to navigate to a combo box now works.
* The selected state of selectable table rows is now reported the same way it is for list and tree view items.
* Controls in Firefox and other Gecko applications can now be activated while in browse mode even if their content has been floated off-screen. (#801)
* You can no longer show an NVDA settings dialog while a message dialog is being shown, as the settings dialog was frozen in this case. (#1451)
* In Microsoft Excel, there is no longer a lag when holding down or rapidly pressing keys to move between or select cells.
* Fixed intermittent crashes of the NVDA service which meant that NVDA stopped running on secure Windows screens.
* Fixed problems that sometimes occurred with braille displays when a change caused text that was being displayed to disappear. (#1377)
* The downloads window in Internet Explorer 9 can now be navigated and read with NVDA. (#1280)
* It is no longer possible to accidentally start multiple copies of NVDA at the same time. (#507)
* On slow systems, NVDA no longer inappropriately causes its main window to be shown all the time while running. (#726)
* NVDA no longer crashes on Windows xP when starting a WPF application. (#1437)
* Say all and say all with review are now able to work in UI automation text controls that support all required functionality. For example, you can now use say all with review on XPS Viewer documents.
* NVDA no longer inappropriately classes some list items in the Outlook Express / Windows Live Mail message rules Apply Now dialog as being checkboxes. (#576)
* Combo boxes are no longer reported as having a sub-menu.
* NVDA is  now able to read the recipiants in the To, CC and BCC fields in Microsoft Outlook. (#421)

## 2011.1.1

This release fixes several security and other important issues found in NVDA 2011.1.

### Bug Fixes

* The Donate item in the NVDA menu is now disabled when running on the logon, lock, UAC and other secure Windows screens, as this is a security risk. (#1419)
* It is now impossible to copy or paste within NVDA's user interface while on secure desktops (lock screen, UAC screen and windows logon) as this is a security risk. (#1421)
* In Firefox 4, the move to containing virtual buffer command (NVDA+control+space) now works as it should to escape embedded objects such as Flash content. (#1429)
* When speaking of command keys is enabled, shifted characters are no longer incorrectly spoken as command keys. (#1422)
* When speaking of command keys is enabled, pressing space with modifiers other than shift (such as control and alt) is now reported as a command key. (#1424)
* Logging is now completely disabled when running on the logon, lock, UAC and other secure Windows screens, as this is a security risk. (#1435)
* In input help mode, Gestures are now logged even if they are not bound to a script (in accordance with the user guide). (#1425)

## 2011.1

Highlights of this release include automatic reporting of new text output in mIRC, PuTTY, Tera Term and SecureCRT; support for global plugins; announcement of bullets and numbering in Microsoft Word; additional key bindings for braille displays, including keys to move to the next and previous line; support for several Baum, HumanWare and APH braille displays; and reporting of colors for some controls, including IBM Lotus Symphony text controls.

### New Features

* Colors can now be reported for some controls. Automatic announcement can be configured in the Document Formatting preferences dialog. It can also be reported on demand using the report text formatting command (NVDA+f).
 * Initially, this is supported in standard IAccessible2 editable text controls (such as in Mozilla applications), RichEdit controls (such as in Wordpad) and IBM Lotus Symphony text controls.
* In virtual buffers, you can now select by page (using shift+pageDown and shift+pageUp) and paragraph (using shift+control+downArrow and shift+control+upArrow). (#639)
* NVDA now automatically reports new text output in mIRC, PuTTY, Tera Term and SecureCRT. (#936)
* Users can now add new key bindings or override existing ones for any script in NVDA by providing a single user input gesture map. (#194)
* Support for global plugins. Global plugins can add new functionality to NVDA which works across all applications. (#281)
* A small beep is now heard when typing characters with the shift key while capslock is on. This can be turned off by unchecking the related new option in the Keyboard settings dialog. (#663)
* hard page breaks are now announced when moving by line in Microsoft Word. (#758)
* Bullets and numbering are now spoken in Microsoft Word when moving by line. (#208)  
* A command to toggle Sleep mode for the current application (NVDA+shift+s) is now available. Sleep mode (previously known as self voicing mode) disables all screen reading functionality in NVDA for a particular application. Very useful for applications that provide their own speech and or screen reading features. Press this command again to disable Sleep mode.
* Some additional braille display key bindings have been added. See the Supported Braille Displays section of the User Guide for details. (#209)
* For the convenience of third party developers, app modules as well as global plugins can now be reloaded without restarting NVDA. Use tools -> Reload plugins in the NVDA menu or NVDA+control+f3. (#544)
* NVDA now remembers the position you were at when returning to a previously visited web page. This applies until either the browser or NVDA is exited. (#132)
* Handy Tech braille displays can now be used without installing the Handy Tech universal driver. (#854)
* Support for several Baum, HumanWare and APH braille displays. (#937)
* The status bar in Media Player Classic Home Cinema is now recognised.
* The Freedom Scientific Focus 40 Blue braille display can now be used when connected via bluetooth. (#1345)

### Changes

* Position information is no longer reported by default in some cases where it was usually incorrect; e.g. most menus, the Running Applications bar, the Notification Area, etc. However, this can be turned on again by an added option in the Object Presentation settings dialog.
* Keyboard help has been renamed to input help to reflect that it handles input from sources other than the keyboard.
* Input Help no longer reports a script's code location via speech and braille as it is cryptic and irrelevant to the user. However, it is now logged for developers and advanced users.
* When NVDA detects that it has frozen, it continues to intercept NVDA modifier keys, even though it passes all other keys through to the system. This prevents the user from unintentionally toggling caps lock, etc. if they press an NVDA modifier key without realising NVDA has frozen. (#939)
* If keys are held down after using the pass next key through command, all keys (including key repeats) are now passed through until the last key is released.
* If an NVDA modifier key is pressed twice in quick succession to pass it through and the second press is held down, all key repeats will now be passed through as well.
* The volume up, down and mute keys are now reported in input help. This could be helpful if the user is uncertain as to what these keys are.
* The hotkey for the Review Cursor item in the NVDA Preferences menu has been changed from r to c to eliminate the conflict with the Braille Settings item.

### Bug Fixes

* When adding a new speech dictionary entry, the title of the dialog is now "Add dictionary entry" instead of "Edit dictionary entry". (#924)
* In speech dictionary dialogs, the content of the Regular expression and Case sensitive columns of the Dictionary entries list is now presented in the configured NVDA language instead of always in English.
* In AIM, position information is now announced in tree views.
* On sliders in the Voice Settings dialog, up arrow/page up/home now increase the setting and down arrow/page down/end decrease it. Previously, the opposite occurred, which is not logical and is inconsistent with the synth settings ring. (#221)
* In virtual buffers with screen layout disabled, some extraneous blank lines no longer appear.
* If an NVDA modifier key is pressed twice quickly but there is an intervening key press, the NVDA modifier key is no longer passed through on the second press.
* Punctuation keys are now spoken in input help even when speaking of punctuation is disabled. (#977)
* In the Keyboard Settings dialog, the keyboard layout names are now presented in the configured NVDA language instead of always in English. (#558)
* Fixed an issue where some items were rendered as empty in Adobe Reader documents; e.g. the links in the table of contents of the Apple iPhone IOS 4.1 User Guide.
* The "Use currently saved settings on the logon and other secure screens" button in NVDA's General Settings dialog now works if used immediately after NVDA is newly installed but before a secure screen has appeared. Previously, NVDA reported that copying was successful, but it actually had no effect. (#1194)
* It is no longer possible to have two NVDA settings dialogs open simultaneously. This fixes issues where one open dialog depends on another open dialog; e.g. changing the synthesiser while the Voice Settings dialog is open. (#603)
* On systems with UAC enabled, the "Use currently saved settings on the logon and other secure screens" button in NVDA's General Settings dialog no longer fails after the UAC prompt if the user's account name contains a space. (#918)
* In Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls, NVDA now uses the URL as a last resort to determine the name of a link, rather than presenting empty links. (#633)
* NVDA no longer ignores the focus  in AOL Instant Messenger 7 menus. (#655)
* Announce the correct label for errors in the Microsoft Word Spell Check dialog (e.g. Not in dictionary, Grammar error, punctuation). Previously  they were all announced as grammar error. (#883)
* Typing in Microsoft Word while using a braille display should no longer cause garbled text to be typed, and a rare freeze when pressing a braille routing key in Word documents has been fixed. (#1212) However a limitation is that Arabic text can no longer be read in Word 2003 and below, while using a braille display. (#627)
* When pressing the delete key in an edit field, the text/cursor on a braille display should now always be updated appropriately to reflect the change. (#947)
* Changes on dynamic pages in Gecko2 documents (E.g. Firefox 4) while multiple tabs are open are now properly reflected by NVDA. Previously only changes in the first tab were reflected. (Mozilla bug 610985)
* NVDA can now properly announce the suggestions for grammar and punctuation errors in Microsoft Word spell check dialog. (#704)
* In Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls, NVDA no longer presents destination anchors as empty links in its virtual buffer. Instead, these anchors are hidden as they should be. (#1326)
* Object navigation around and within standard groupbox windows is no longer broken and asymmetrical.
* In Firefox and other Gecko-based controls, NVDA will no longer get stuck in a subframe if it finishes loading before the outer document.
* NVDA  now appropriately announces the next character when deleting a character with numpadDelete. (#286)
* On the Windows XP logon screen, the user name is once again reported when the selected user is changed.
* Fixed problems when reading text in Windows command consoles with reporting of line numbers enabled.
* The Elements List dialog for virtual buffers is now usable by sighted users. All controls are visible on screen. (#1321)
* The list of entries in the Speech Dictionary dialog is now more readable by sighted users. The list is now large enough to show all of its columns on screen. (#90)
* On ALVA BC640/BC680 braille displays, NVDA no longer disregards display keys that are still held down after another key is released.
* Adobe Reader X no longer crashes after leaving the untagged document options before the processing dialog appears. (#1218)
* NVDA now switches to the appropriate braille display driver when you revert to saved configuration. (#1346)
* The Visual Studio 2008 Project Wizard is read correctly again. (#974)
* NVDA no longer completely fails to work in applications which contain non-ASCII characters in their executable name. (#1352)
* When reading by line in AkelPad with word wrap enabled, NVDA no longer reads the first character of the following line at the end of the current line.
* In the Visual Studio 2005/2008 code editor, NVDA no longer reads the entire text after every typed character. (#975)
* Fixed the issue where some braille displays weren't cleared properly when NVDA was exited or the display was changed.
* The initial focus is no longer sometimes spoken twice when NVDA starts. (#1359)

### Changes for Developers

* SCons is now used to prepare the source tree and create binary builds, portable archives, installers, etc. See readme.txt at the root of the source distribution for details.
* The key names used by NVDA (including key maps) have been made more friendly/logical; e.g. upArrow instead of extendedUp and numpadPageUp instead of prior. See the vkCodes module for a list.
* All input from the user is now represented by an inputCore.InputGesture instance. (#601)
 * Each source of input subclasses the base InputGesture class.
 * Key presses on the system keyboard are encompassed by the keyboardHandler.KeyboardInputGesture class.
 * Presses of buttons, wheels and other controls on a braille display are encompassed by subclasses of the braille.BrailleDisplayGesture class. These subclasses are provided by each braille display driver.
* Input gestures are bound to ScriptableObjects using the ScriptableObject.bindGesture() method on an instance or an __gestures dict on the class which maps gesture identifiers to script names. See baseObject.ScriptableObject for details.
* App modules no longer have key map files. All input gesture bindings must be done in the app module itself.
* All scripts now take an InputGesture instance instead of a key press.
 * KeyboardInputGestures can be sent on to the OS using the send() method of the gesture.
* To send an arbitrary key press, you must now create a KeyboardInputGesture using KeyboardInputGesture.fromName() and then use its send() method.
* Locales may now provide an input gesture map file to add new bindings or override existing bindings for scripts anywhere in NVDA. (#810)
 * Locale gesture maps should be placed in locale\LANG\gestures.ini, where LANG is the language code.
 * See inputCore.GlobalGestureMap for details of the file format.
* The new LiveText and Terminal NVDAObject behaviors facilitate automatic reporting of new text. See those classes in NVDAObjects.behaviors for details. (#936)
 * The NVDAObjects.window.DisplayModelLiveText overlay class can be used for objects which must retrieve text written to the display.
 * See the mirc and putty app modules for usage examples.
* There is no longer an _default app module. App modules should instead subclass appModuleHandler.AppModule (the base AppModule class).
* Support for global plugins which can globally bind scripts, handle NVDAObject events and choose NVDAObject overlay classes. (#281) See globalPluginHandler.GlobalPlugin for details.
* On SynthDriver objects, the available* attributes for string settings (e.g. availableVoices and availableVariants)  are now OrderedDicts keyed by ID instead of lists.
* synthDriverHandler.VoiceInfo now takes an optional language argument which specifies the language of the voice.
* SynthDriver objects now provide a language attribute which specifies the language of the current voice.
 * The base implementation uses the language specified on the VoiceInfo objects in availableVoices. This is suitable for most synthesisers which support one language per voice.
* Braille display drivers have been enhanced to allow buttons, wheels and other controls to be bound to NVDA scripts:
 * Drivers can provide a global input gesture map to add bindings for scripts anywhere in NVDA.
 * They can also provide their own scripts to perform display specific functions.
 * See braille.BrailleDisplayDriver for details and existing braille display drivers for examples.
* The 'selfVoicing' property on AppModule classes has now been renamed to 'sleepMode'.
* The app module events event_appLoseFocus and event_appGainFocus have now been renamed to event_appModule_loseFocus and event_appModule_gainFocus, respectivly, in order to make the naming convention consistent with app modules and tree interceptors.
* All braille display drivers should now use braille.BrailleDisplayDriver instead of braille.BrailleDisplayDriverWithCursor.
 * The cursor is now managed outside of the driver.
 * Existing drivers need only change their class statement accordingly and rename their _display method to display.

## 2010.2

Notable features of this release include greatly simplified object navigation; virtual buffers for Adobe Flash content; access to many previously inaccessible controls by retrieving text written to the screen; flat review of screen text; support for IBM Lotus Symphony documents; reporting of table row and column headers in Mozilla Firefox; and significantly improved user documentation.

### New Features

* Navigating through objects with the review cursor has been greatly simplified. The review cursor now excludes objects which aren't useful to the user; i.e. objects only used for layout purposes and unavailable objects.
* In applications using the Java Access Bridge (including OpenOffice.org), formatting can now be reported in text controls. (#358, #463)
* When moving the mouse over cells in Microsoft Excel, NVDA will appropriately announce them.
* In applications using the Java Access Bridge, the text of a dialog is now reported when the dialog appears. (#554)
* A virtualBuffer can now be used to navigate adobe Flash content. Object navigation and interacting with the controls directly (by turning on focus mode) is still supported. (#453)
* Editable text controls in the Eclipse IDE, including the code editor, are now accessible. You must be using Eclipse 3.6 or later. (#256, #641)
* NVDA can now retrieve most text written to the screen. (#40, #643)
 * This allows for reading of controls which do not expose information in more direct/reliable ways.
 * Controls made accessible by this feature include: some menu items which display icons (e.g. the Open With menu on files in Windows XP) (#151), editable text fields in Windows Live applications (#200), the errors list in Outlook Express (#582), the editable text control in TextPad (#605), lists in Eudora, many controls in Australian E-tax and the formula bar in Microsoft Excel.
* Support for the code editor in Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and 2008. At least Visual Studio Standard is required; this does not work in the Express editions. (#457)
* Support for IBM Lotus Symphony documents.
* Early experimental support for Google Chrome. Please note that Chrome's screen reader support is far from complete and additional work may also be required in NVDA. You will need a recent development build of Chrome to try this.
* The state of toggle keys (caps lock, num lock and scroll lock) is now displayed in braille when they are pressed. (#620)
* Help balloons are now displayed in braille when they appear. (#652)
* Added a driver for the MDV Lilli braille display. (#241)
* When selecting an entire row or column in Microsoft Excel with the shortcut keys shift+space and control+space, the new selection is now reported. (#759)
* Table row and column headers can now be reported. This is configurable from the Document Formatting preferences dialog.
 * Currently, this is supported in documents in Mozilla applications such as Firefox (version 3.6.11 and later) and Thunderbird (version 3.1.5 and later). (#361)
* Introduced commands for flat review: (#58)
 * NVDA+numpad7  switches to flat review, placing the review cursor at the position of the current object, allowing you  to review the screen (or a document if within one) with the text review commands.
 * NVDA+numpad1 moves the review cursor into the object represented by the text at  the position of the review cursor, allowing you to navigate by object from that point.
* Current NVDA user settings can be  copied to be used on secure Windows screens such as the logon and UAC screens by pressing a button in the General Settings dialog. (#730)
* Support for Mozilla Firefox 4.
* Support for Microsoft Internet Explorer 9.

### Changes

* The sayAll by Navigator object (NVDA+numpadAdd), navigator object next in flow (NVDA+shift+numpad6) and navigator object previous in flow (NVDA+shift+numpad4) commands have been removed for the time being, due to bugginess and to free up the keys for other possible features.
* In the NVDA Synthesizer dialog, only the display name of the synthesizer is now listed. Previously, it was prefixed by the driver's name, which is only relevant internally.
* When in embedded applications or virtual buffers inside another virtualBuffer (e.g. Flash), you can now  press nvda+control+space to move out of the embedded application or virtual buffer to the containing document. Previously nvda+space  was used for this. Now nvda+space is specifically only for toggling brows/focus modes on virtualBuffers.
* If the speech viewer (enabled under the tools menu) is given the focus (e.g. it was clicked in) new text will not appear in the control until focus is moved away. This allows for selecting the text with greater ease (e.g. for copying).
* The Log Viewer and Python Console are maximised when activated.
* When focusing on a worksheet in Microsoft Excel and there is more than one cell selected, the selection range is announced, rather than just the active cell. (#763)
* Saving configuration and changing of particular sensitive options is now disabled when running on the logon, UAC and other secure Windows screens.
* Updated eSpeak speech synthesiser to 1.44.03.
* If NVDA is already running, activating the NVDA shortcut on the desktop (which includes pressing control+alt+n) will restart NVDA.
* Removed the report text under the mouse checkbox from the Mouse settings dialog and replaced it with an Enable mouse tracking checkbox, which better matches the toggle mouse tracking script (NVDA+m). 
* Updates to the laptop keyboard layout so that it includes all commands available in the desktop layout and works correctly on non-English keyboards. (#798, #800)
* Significant improvements and updates to the user documentation, including documentation of the laptop keyboard commands and synchronisation of the Keyboard Commands Quick Reference with the User Guide. (#455)
* Updated liblouis braille translator to 2.1.1. Notably, this fixes some issues related to Chinese braille as well as characters which are undefined in the translation table. (#484, #499)

### Bug Fixes

* In µTorrent, the focused item in the torrents list no longer reports repeatedly or steals focus when a menu is open.
* In µTorrent, the names of the files in the Torrent Contents list are now reported.
* In Mozilla applications, focus is now correctly detected when it lands on an empty table or tree.
* In Mozilla applications, "not checked" is now correctly reported for checkable controls such as checkable table cells. (#571)
* In Mozilla applications, the text of correctly implemented ARIA dialogs is no longer ignored and will now be reported when the dialog appears. (#630)
* in Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls, the ARIA level attribute is now  honoured correctly.
* In Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls, the ARIA role is now chosen over other type information to give a much more correct and predictable ARIA experience.
* Stopped a rare crash in Internet Explorer when navigating through frames or iFrames.
* In Microsoft Word documents, right-to-left lines (such as Arabic text) can be read again. (#627)
* Greatly reduced lag when large amounts of text are displayed in a Windows command console on 64-bit systems. (#622)
* If Skype is already started when NVDA starts, it is no longer necessary to restart Skype to enable accessibility. This may also be true for other applications which check the system screen reader flag.
* In Microsoft Office applications, NVDA no longer crashes when speak foreground (NVDA+b) is pressed or when navigating some objects on toolbars. (#616)
* Fixed incorrect speaking of numbers containing a 0 after a separator; e.g. 1,023. (#593)
* Adobe Acrobat Pro and Reader 9 no longer crash when closing a file or performing certain other tasks. (#613)
* The selection is now announced when control+a is pressed to select all text in some editable text controls such as in Microsoft Word. (#761)
* In Scintilla controls (e.g. Notepad++), text is no longer incorrectly selected when NVDA moves the caret such as during say all. (#746)
* It is again possible to review the contents of cells in Microsoft Excel with the review cursor.
* NVDA can again read by line in certain problematic textArea fields in Internet Explorer 8. (#467)
* Windows Live Messenger 2009 no longer exits immediately after it is started while NVDA is running. (#677)
* In web browsers, It is no longer necessary to press tab to interact with an embedded object (such as Flash content) after pressing enter on the embedded object or returning from another application. (#775)
* In Scintilla controls (e.g. Notepad++), the beginning of long lines is no longer truncated when it scrolls off the screen. Also, these long lines will be correctly displayed in braille when they are selected.
* In Loudtalks, it is now possible to access the contact list.
* The URL of the document and "MSAAHTML Registered Handler" are no longer sometimes spuriously reported in Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls. (#811)
* In tree views in the Eclipse IDE, the previously focused item is no longer incorrectly announced when focus moves to a new item.
* NVDA now functions correctly on a system where the current working directory has been removed from the DLL search path (by setting the CWDIllegalInDllSearch registry entry to 0xFFFFFFFF). Note that this is not relevant to most users. (#907)
* When the table navigation commands are used outside of a table in Microsoft Word, "edge of table" is no longer spoken after "not in table". (#921)
* When the table navigation commands cannot move due to being at the edge of a table in Microsoft Word, "edge of table" is now spoken in the configured NVDA language rather than always in English. (#921)
* In Outlook Express, Windows Mail and Windows Live Mail, the state of the checkboxes in message rules lists is now reported. (#576)
* The description of message rules can now be read in Windows Live Mail 2010.

## 2010.1

This release focuses primarily on bug fixes and improvements to the user experience, including some significant stability fixes.

### New Features

* NVDA no longer fails to start on a system with no audio output devices. Obviously, a braille display or the Silence synthesiser in conjunction with the Speech Viewer will need to be used for output in this case. (#425)
* A report landmarks checkbox has been added to the Document Formatting settings dialog which allows you to configure whether NVDA should announce landmarks in web documents. For compatibility with the previous release, the option is on by default.
* If speak command keys is enabled, NVDA will now announce the names of multimedia keys (e.g. play, stop, home page, etc.) on many keyboards when they are pressed. (#472)
* NVDA now announces the word being deleted when pressing control+backspace in controls that support it. (#491)
* Arrow keys can now be used in the Web formator window to navigate and read the text. (#452)
* The entry list in the Microsoft Office Outlook address book is now supported.
* NVDA better supports embedded editable (design mode) documents in Internet Explorer. (#402)
* a new script (nvda+shift+numpadMinus) allows you to move the system focus to the current navigator object.
* New scripts to lock and unlock the left and right mouse buttons. Useful for performing drag and drop operations. shift+numpadDivide to lock/unlock the left, shift+numpadMultiply to lock/unlock the right.
* New braille translation tables: German 8 dot computer braille, German grade 2, Finnish 8 dot computer braille, Chinese (Hong Kong, Cantonese), Chinese (Taiwan, Manderin). (#344, #369, #415, #450)
* It is now possible to disable the creation of the desktop shortcut (and thus the shortcut key) when installing NVDA. (#518)
* NVDA can now use IAccessible2 when present in 64 bit applications. (#479)
* Improved support for live regions in Mozilla applications. (#246)
* The NVDA Controller Client API is now provided to allow applications to control NVDA; e.g. to speak text, silence speech, display a message in Braille, etc.
* Information and error messages are now read in the logon screen in Windows Vista and Windows 7. (#506)
* In Adobe Reader, PDF interactive forms developed with Adobe LiveCycle are now supported. (#475)
* In Miranda IM, NVDA now automatically reads incoming messages in chat windows if reporting of dynamic content changes is enabled. Also, commands have been added to report the three most recent messages (NVDA+control+number). (#546)
* Input text fields are now supported in Adobe Flash content. (#461)

### Changes

* The extremely verbose keyboard help message in the Windows 7 Start menu is no longer reported.
* The Display synth has now been replaced with a new Speech Viewer. To activate it, choose Speech Viewer from the Tools menu. The speech viewer can be used independently of what ever speech synthesizer you are using. (#44)
* Messages on the braille display will automatically be dismissed if the user presses a key that results in a change such as the focus moving. Previously the message would always stay around for its configured time.
* Setting whether braille should be tethered to the focus or the review cursor (NVDA+control+t) can now be also set from the braille settings dialog, and is also now saved in the user's configuration.
* Updated eSpeak speech synthesiser to 1.43.
* Updated liblouis braille translator to 1.8.0.
* In virtual buffers, the reporting of elements when moving by character or word has been greatly improved. Previously, a lot of irrelevant information was reported and the reporting was very different to that when moving by line. (#490)
* The Control key now simply stops speech like other keys, rather than pausing speech. To pause/resume speech, use the shift key.
* Table row and column counts are no longer announced when reporting focus changes, as this announcement is rather verbose and usually not useful.

### Bug Fixes

* NVDA no longer fails to start if UI Automation support appears to be available but fails to initialise for some reason. (#483)
* The entire contents of a table row is no longer sometimes reported when moving focus inside a cell  in Mozilla applications. (#482)
* NVDA no longer lags for a long time when expanding tree view items that contain a very large amount of sub-items.
* When listing SAPI 5 voices, NVDA now tries to detect buggy voices and excludes them from the Voice Settings dialog and synthesiser settings ring. Previously, when there was just one problematic voice, NVDA's SAPI 5 driver would sometimes fail to start.
* Virtual buffers now honour the report object shortcut keys setting found in the Object Presentation dialog. (#486)
* In virtual buffers, row/column coordinates are no longer incorrectly read for row and column headers when reporting of tables is disabled.
* In virtual buffers, row/column coordinates are now correctly read when you leave a table and then re-enter the same table cell without visiting another cell first; e.g. pressing upArrow then downArrow on the first cell of a table. (#378)
* Blank lines in Microsoft Word documents and  Microsoft HTML edit controls are now shown appropriately on braille displays. Previously NVDA was displaying the current sentence on the display, not the current line for these situations. (#420)
* Multiple security fixes when running NVDA at Windows logon and on other secure desktops. (#515)
* The cursor position (caret) is now correctly updated when performing a Say All that goes off the bottom of the screen, in standard Windows edit fields and Microsoft Word documents. (#418)
* In virtual buffers, text is no longer incorrectly included for images inside links and clickables that are marked as being irrelevant to screen readers. (#423)
* Fixes to the laptop keyboard layout. (#517)
* When Braille is tethered to review when you focus on a Dos console window, the review cursor can now properly navigate the text in the console.
* While working with TeamTalk3 or TeamTalk4 Classic, the VU meter progress bar in the main window is no longer announced as it updates. Also, special characters can be read properly in the incoming chat window.
* Items are no longer spoken twice in the Windows 7 Start Menu. (#474)
* Activating same-page links in Firefox 3.6 appropriately moves the cursor in the virtualBuffer to the correct place on the page.
* Fixed the issue where some text was not rendered in Adobe Reader in certain PDF documents.
* NVDA no longer incorrectly speaks certain numbers separated by a dash; e.g. 500-1000. (#547)
* In Windows XP, NVDA no longer causes Internet Explorer to freeze when toggling checkboxes in Windows Update. (#477)
* When using the in-built eSpeak synthesiser, simultaneous speech and beeps no longer intermittently cause freezes on some systems. This was most noticeable, for example, when copying large amounts of data in Windows Explorer.
* NVDA no longer announces that a Firefox document has become busy (e.g. due to an update or refresh) when that document is in the background. This also caused the status bar of the foreground application to be spuriously announced.
* When switching Windows keyboard layouts (with control+shift or alt+shift), the full name of the layout is reported in both speech and braille. Previously it was only reported in speech, and alternative layouts (e.g. Dvorak) were not reported at all.
* If reporting of tables is disabled, table information is no longer announced when the focus changes.
* Certain standard tree view controls in 64 bit applications (e.g. the Contents tree view in Microsoft HTML Help) are now accessible. (#473)
* Fixed some problems with logging of messages containing non-ASCII characters. This could cause spurious errors in some cases on non-English systems. (#581)
* The information in the About NVDA dialog now appears in the user's configured language instead of always appearing in English. (#586)
* Problems are no longer encountered when using the synthesiser settings ring after the voice is changed to one which has less settings than the previous voice.
* In Skype 4.2, contact names are no longer spoken twice in the contact list.
* Fixed some potentially major memory leaks in the GUI and in virtual buffers. (#590, #591)
* Work around a nasty bug in some SAPI 4 synthesisers which was causing frequent errors and crashes in NVDA. (#597)

## 2009.1

Major highlights of this release include support for 64 bit editions of Windows; greatly improved support for Microsoft Internet Explorer and Adobe Reader documents; support for Windows 7; reading of the Windows logon, control+alt+delete and User Account Control (UAC) screens; and the ability to interact with Adobe Flash and Sun Java content on web pages. There have also been several significant stability fixes and improvements to the general user experience.

### New Features

* Official support for 64 bit editions of Windows! (#309)
* Added a synthesizer driver for the Newfon synthesizer. Note that this requires a special version of Newfon. (#206)
* In virtual buffers, focus mode and browse mode can now be reported using sounds instead of speech. This is enabled by default. It can be configured from the Virtual buffers dialog. (#244)
* NVDA no longer cancels speech when volume control keys are pressed on the keyboard, allowing the user to change the volume and listen to actual results immediately. (#287)
* Completely rewritten support for Microsoft Internet Explorer and Adobe Reader documents. This support has been unified with the core support used for Mozilla Gecko, so features such as fast page rendering, extensive quick navigation, links list, text selection, auto focus mode and braille support are now available with these documents.
* Improved support for the date selection control found in the Windows Vista Date / Time properties dialog.
* improved support for the Modern XP/Vista start menu (specifically the all programs, and places menus). Appropriate level information is now announced.
* The amount of text that is announced when moving the mouse is now configurable from the Mouse settings dialog. A choice of paragraph, line, word or character can be made.
* announce spelling errors under the cursor in Microsoft Word.
* support for the Microsoft Word 2007 spell checker. Partial support may be available for prior Microsoft Word versions.
* Better support for Windows Live Mail. Plain text messages can now be read and both the plain text and HTML message composers are useable.
* In Windows Vista, if the user moves to the secure desktop (either because a UAC control dialog appeared, or because control+alt+delete was pressed), NVDA will announce the fact that the user is now on the secure desktop.
* NVDA can announce text under the mouse within dos console windows.
* Support for UI Automation via the UI Automation client API available in Windows 7, as well as fixes to improve the experience of NVDA in Windows 7.
* NVDA can be configured to start automatically after you log on to Windows. The option is in the General Settings dialog.
* NVDA can read secure Windows screens such as the Windows logon, control+alt+delete and User Account Control (UAC) screens in Windows XP and above. Reading of the Windows logon screen can be configured from the General Settings dialog. (#97)
* Added a driver for the Optelec ALVA BC6 series braille displays.
* When browsing web documents, you can now press n and shift+n to skip forward and backward past blocks of links, respectively.
* When browsing web documents, ARIA landmarks are now reported, and you can move forward and backward through them using d and shift+d, respectively. (#192)
* The Links List dialog available when browsing web documents has now become an Elements List dialog which can list links, headings and landmarks. Headings and landmarks are presented hierarchically. (#363)
* The new Elements List dialog contains a "Filter by" field which allows you to filter the list to contain only those items including the text that was typed. (#173)
* Portable versions of NVDA now look in the 'userConfig' directory inside the NVDA directory, for the user's configuration. Like for the installer version, this keeps the user's configuration separate from NVDA itself.
* Custom app modules, braille display drivers and synth drivers can now be stored in the user's configuration  directory. (#337)
* Virtual buffers are now rendered in the background, allowing the user to interact with the system to some extent during the rendering process. The user will be notified that the document is being rendered if it takes longer than a second.
* If NVDA detects that it has frozen for some reason, it will automatically pass all keystrokes through so that the user has a better chance of recovering the system.
* Support for ARIA drag and drop in Mozilla Gecko. (#239)
* The document title and current line or selection is now spoken when you move focus inside a virtual buffer. This makes the behaviour when moving focus into virtual buffers consistent with that for normal document objects. (#210)
* In virtual buffers, you can now interact with embedded objects (such as Adobe Flash and Sun Java content) by pressing enter on the object. If it is accessible, you can then tab around it like any other application. To return focus to the document, press NVDA+space. (#431)
* In virtual buffers, o and shift+o move to the next and previous embedded object, respectively.
* NVDA can now fully access applications running as administrator in Windows Vista and later. You must install an official release of NVDA for this to work. This does not work for portable versions and snapshots. (#397)

### Changes

* NVDA no longer announces "NVDA started" when it starts.
* The startup and exit sounds are now played using NVDA's configured audio output device instead of the Windows default audio output device. (#164)
* Progress bar reporting has been improved. Most notably you can now configure NVDA to announce via both speech and beeps at the same time.
* Some generic roles, such as pane, application and frame, are no longer reported on focus unless the control is unnamed.
* The review copy command (NVDA+f10) copies the text from the start marker up to and including the current review position, rather than excluding the current position. This allows the last character of a line to be copied, which was not previously possible. (#430)
* the navigatorObject_where script (ctrl+NVDA+numpad5) has been removed. This key combination did not work on some keyboards, nore was the script found to be that useful.
* the navigatorObject_currentDimentions script has been remapped to NVDA+numpadDelete. The old key combination did not work on some keyboards. This script also now reports the width and height of the object instead of the right/bottom coordinates.
* Improved performance (especially on netbooks) when many beeps occur in quick succession; e.g. fast mouse movement with audio coordinates enabled. (#396)
* The NVDA error sound is no longer played in release candidates and final releases. Note that errors are still logged.

### Bug Fixes

* When NVDA is run from an 8.3 dos path, but it is installed in the related long path (e.g. progra~1 verses program files) NVDA will correctly  identify that it is an installed copy and properly load the user's settings.
* speaking the title of the current foreground window with nvda+t now works correctly when in menus.
* braille no longer shows useless information in its focus context such as unlabeled panes.
* stop announcing some useless information when the focus changes such as root panes, layered panes and scroll panes in Java or Lotus applications.
* Make the  keyword search field in Windows Help (CHM) viewer much more usable. Due to buggyness in that control, the current keyword could not be read as it would be continually changing.
* report correct page numbers in Microsoft Word if the page numbering has been specifically offset in the document.
* Better support for edit fields found in Microsoft Word dialogs (e.g. the Font dialog). It is now possible  to navigate these controls with the arrow keys.
* better support for Dos consoles. specifically: NVDA can now read the content of particular consoles it always used to think were blank. Pressing control+break no longer terminates NVDA.
* On Windows Vista and above, the NVDA installer now starts NVDA with normal user privileges when requested to run NVDA on the finish screen.
* Backspace is now handled correctly when speaking typed words. (#306)
* Don't incorrectly report "Start menu" for certain context menus in Windows Explorer/the Windows shell. (#257)
* NVDA now correctly handles ARIA labels in Mozilla Gecko when there is no other useful content. (#156)
* NVDA no longer incorrectly enables focus mode automatically for editable text fields which update their value when the focus changes; e.g. http://tigerdirect.com/. (#220)
* NVDA will now attempt to recover from some situations which would previously cause it to freeze completely. It may take up to 10 seconds for NVDA to detect and recover from such a freeze.
* When the NVDA language is set to "User default", use the user's Windows  display language setting instead of the Windows locale setting. (#353)
* NVDA now recognises the existence of controls in AIM 7.
* The pass key through command no longer gets stuck if a key is held down. Previously, NVDA stopped accepting commands if this occurred and had to be restarted. (#413)
* The taskbar is no longer ignored when it receives focus, which often occurs when exiting an application. Previously, NVDA behaved as if the focus had not changed at all.
* When reading text fields in applications which use the Java Access Bridge (including OpenOffice.org), NVDA now functions correctly when reporting of line numbers is enabled.
* The review copy command (NVDA+f10) gracefully handles the case where it is used on a position before the start marker. Previously, this could cause problems such as crashes in Notepad++.
* A certain control character (0x1) no longer causes strange eSpeak behaviour (such as changes in volume and pitch) when it is encountered in text. (#437)
* The report text selection command (NVDA+shift+upArrow) now gracefully reports that there is no selection in objects which do not support text selection.
* Fixed the issue where pressing the enter key on certain Miranda-IM buttons or links was causing NVDA to freeze. (#440)
* The current line or selection is now properly respected when spelling or copying the current navigator object.
* Worked around a Windows bug which was causing garbage to be spoken after the name of link controls in Windows Explorer and Internet Explorer dialogs. (#451)
* Fixed a problem with the report date and time command (NVDA+f12). Previously, date reporting was truncated on some systems. (#471)
* Fixed the issue where the system screen reader flag was sometimes inappropriately cleared after interacting with secure Windows screens. This could cause problems in applications which check the screen reader flag, including Skype, Adobe Reader and Jart. (#462)
* In an Internet Explorer 6 combo box, the active item is now reported when it is changed. (#342)

## 0.6p3

### New Features

* As Microsoft Excel's formula bar is inaccessible to NVDA, provide an NVDA specific dialog box for editing when the user presses f2 on a cell.
* Support for formatting in IAccessible2 text controls, including Mozilla applications.
* Spelling errors can now be reported where possible. This is configurable from the Document Formatting preferences dialog.
* NVDA can be configured to beep for either all or only visible progress bars. Alternatively, it can be configured to speak progress bar values every 10%.
* Links can now be identified in richedit controls.
* The mouse can now be moved to the character under the review cursor in most editable text controls. Previously, the mouse could only be moved to the center of the control.
* In virtual buffers, the review cursor now reviews the text of the buffer, rather than just the internal text of the navigator object (which is often not useful to the user). This means that you can navigate the virtual buffer hierarchically using object navigation and the review cursor will move to that point in the buffer.
* Handle some additional states on Java controls.
* If the title command (NVDA+t) is pressed twice, it spells the title. If pressed thrice, it is copied to the clipboard.
* Keyboard help now reads the names of modifier keys when pressed alone.
* Key names announced by keyboard help are now translatable.
* Added support for the recognized text field in SiRecognizer. (#198)
* Support for braille displays!
* Added a command (NVDA+c) to report the text on the Windows clipboard. (#193)
* In virtualBuffers, if NVDA automatically switches to focus mode, you can use the escape key to switch back to browse mode. NVDA+space can still also be used.
* In virtual buffers, when the focus changes or the caret is moved, NVDA can automatically switch to focus mode or browse mode as appropriate for the control under the caret. This is configured from the Virtual Buffers dialog. (#157)
* Rewritten SAPI4 synthesizer driver which replaces the sapi4serotek and sapi4activeVoice drivers and should fix the problems encountered with these drivers.
* The NVDA application now includes a manifest, which means that it no longer runs in compatibility mode in Windows Vista.
* The configuration file and speech dictionaries are now saved in the user's application data directory if NVDA was installed using the installer. This is necessary for Windows Vista and also allows multiple users to have individual NVDA configurations.
* Added support for position information for IAccessible2 controls.
* Added the ability to copy text to the clipboard using the review cursor. NVDA+f9 sets the start marker to the current position of the review cursor. NVDA+f10 retrieves the text between the start marker and the current position of the review cursor and copies it to the clipboard. (#240)
* Added support for some edit controls in pinacle tv software.
* When announcing selected text for long selections (512 characters or more), NVDA now speaks the number of selected characters, rather than speaking the entire selection. (#249)

### Changes

* If the audio output device is set to use the Windows default device (Microsoft Sound Mapper), NVDA will now switch to the new default device for eSpeak and tones when the default device changes. For example, NVDA will switch to a USB audio device if it automatically becomes the default device when it is connected.
* Improve performance of eSpeak with some Windows Vista audio drivers.
* reporting of links, headings, tables, lists and block quotes can now be configured from the Document Formatting settings dialog. Previously to configure these settings for virtual buffers, the virtual buffer settings dialog would have been used. Now all documents share this configuration.
* Rate is now the default setting in the speech synthesizer settings ring.
* Improve the loading and unloading of appModules.
* The title command (NVDA+t) now only reports the title instead of the entire object. If the foreground object has no name, the application's process name is used.
* Instead of virtual buffer pass through on and off, NVDA now reports focus mode (pass through on) and browse mode (pass through off).
* Voices are now stored in the configuration file by ID instead of by index. This makes voice settings more reliable across systems and configuration changes. The voice setting will not be preserved in old configurations and an error may be logged the first time a synthesizer is used. (#19)
* The level of a tree view item is now announced first if it has changed from the previously focused item for all tree views. Previously, this was only occurring for native Windows (SysTreeView32) tree views.

### Bug Fixes

* The last chunk of audio is no longer cut off when using NVDA with eSpeak on a remote desktop server.
* Fix problems with saving speech dictionaries for certain voices.
* Eliminate the lag when moving by units other than character (word, line, etc.) towards the bottom of large plain text documents in Mozilla Gecko virtual buffers. (#155)
* If speak typed words is enabled, announce the word when enter is pressed.
* Fix some character set issues in richedit documents.
* The NVDA log viewer now uses richedit instead of just edit to display the log. This improves reading by word with NVDA.
* Fix some issues related to embedded objects in richedit controls.
* NVDA now reads page numbers in Microsoft Word. (#120)
* Fix the issue where tabbing to a checked checkbox in a Mozilla Gecko virtual buffer and pressing space would not announce that the checkbox was being unchecked.
* Correctly report partially checked checkboxes in Mozilla applications.
* If the text selection expands or shrinks in both directions, read the selection as one chunk instead of two.
* When reading with the mouse, text in Mozilla Gecko edit fields should now be read.
* Say all should no longer cause certain SAPI5 synthesizers to crash.
* Fixed an issue which meant that text selection changes were not being read in Windows standard edit controls before the first focus change after NVDA was started.
* Fix mouse tracking in Java objects. (#185)
* NVDA no longer reports Java tree view items with no children as being collapsed.
* Announce the object with focus when a Java window comes to the foreground. Previously, only the top-level Java object was announced.
* The eSpeak synthesizer driver no longer stops speaking completely after a single error.
* Fix the issue whereby updated voice parameters (rate, pitch, etc.) were not saved when the voice was changed from the synthesizer settings ring.
* Improved the speaking of typed characters and words.
* Some new text that was previously not spoken in text console applications (such as some text adventure games) is now spoken.
* NVDA now ignores focus changes in background windows. Previously, a background focus change could be treated as if the real focus changed.
* Improved the detection of the focus when leaving context menus. Previously, NVDA often didn't react at all when leaving a context menu.
* NVDA now announces when the context menu is activated in the Start menu.
* The classic Start menu is now announced as Start menu instead of Application menu.
* Improved the reading of alerts such as those encountered in Mozilla Firefox. The text should no longer be read multiple times and other extraneous information will no longer be read. (#248)
* The text of focusable, read-only edit fields will no longer be included when retrieving the text of dialogs. This fixes, for example, the automatic reading of the entire license agreement in installers.
* NVDA no longer announces the unselection of text when leaving some edit controls (example: Internet Explorer address bar, Thunderbird 3 email address fields).
* When opening plain text emails in Outlook Express and Windows Mail, focus is correctly placed in the message ready for the user to read it. Previously the user had to press tab or click on the message in order to use cursor keys to read it.
* Fixed several major issues with the "Speak command keys" functionality.
* NVDA can now read text past 65535 characters in standard edit controls (e.g. a large file in Notepad).
* Improved line reading in MSHTML edit fields (Outlook Express editable messages and Internet Explorer text input fields).
* NVDA no longer sometimes freezes completely when editing text in OpenOffice. (#148, #180)

* Added scripts to click the left and right mouse buttons (numpadSlash and numpadStar respectively)
* Improve access to the Windows System Tray. Focus hopefully should no longer seem to keep jumping back to one particular item. Reminder: to get to the System Tray use the Windows command WindowsKey+b. (#10)
* Improve performance and stop announcing extra text when holding down a cursor key in an edit field and it hits the end
* Stop the ability for NVDA to make the user wait while particular messages are spoken. Fixes some crashes/freezes with particular speech synthesizers. (#117)

* Read cells in MS Excel when moving with tab and shift+tab. (#146)
* Fix some double speaking in particular lists in Skype.
* Improved caret tracking in IAccessible2 and Java applications; e.g. in Open Office and Lotus Symphony, NVDA properly waits for the caret to move in documents rather than accidentally reading the wrong word or line at the end of some paragraphs. (#119)
* Support for AkelEdit controls found in Akelpad 4.0
* NVDA no longer locks up in Lotus Synphony when moving from the document to the menu bar.
* NVDA no longer freezes in the Windows XP Add/Remove programs applet when launching an uninstaller. (#30)
* NVDA no longer freezes when opening Spybot Search and Destroy

## 0.6p1

### Access to web content with new in-process virtualBuffers (so far for Mozilla Gecko applications including Firefox3 and Thunderbird3)

* Load times have been improved almost by a factor of thirty (you no longer have to wait at all for most web pages to load in to the buffer)
* Added a links list (NVDA+f7)
* Improved the find dialog (control+nvda+f) so that it performs a case-insencitive search, plus fixed a few focus issues with that dialog box.
* It is now possible to select and copy text in the new virtualBuffers
* By default the new virtualBuffers represent the document in a screen layout (links and controls are not on separate lines unless they really are visually). You can toggle this feature with NVDA+v.
* It is possible to move by paragraph with control+upArrow and control+downArrow.
* Improved support for dynamic content
* Improved over all accuracy of reading lines and fields when arrowing up and down.

### Internationalization

* It is now possible to type accented characters that rely on a "dead character", while NVDA is running.
* NVDA now announces when the keyboard layout is changed (when pressing alt+shift).
* The announce date and time feature now takes the system's current regional and language options in to account.
* added czech translation (by Tomas Valusek with help from Jaromir Vit)
* added vietnamese translation by Dang Hoai Phuc
* Added Africaans (af_ZA) translation, by Willem van der Walt.
* Added russian translation by Dmitry Kaslin 
* Added polish translation by DOROTA CZAJKA and friends.
* Added Japanese translation by Katsutoshi Tsuji.
* added Thai translation by Amorn Kiattikhunrat
* added croatian translation by Mario Percinic and Hrvoje Katic  
* Added galician translation by Juan C. buno 
* added ukrainian translation by Aleksey Sadovoy 

### Speech

* NVDA now comes packaged with eSpeak 1.33 which contains many improvements, among those are improved languages, named variants, ability to speak faster.
* The voice settings dialog now allows you to change the variant of a synthesizer if it supports one. Variant is usually a slight variation on the current voice. (eSpeak supports variants).
* Added the ability to change the inflection of a voice in the voice settings dialog if the current synthesizer supports this. (eSpeak supports inflection).
* Added the ability to turn off speaking of object position information(e.g. 1 of 4). This option can be found in the Object presentation settings dialog.
* NVDA can now beep when speaking a capital letter. This can be turned on and off with a check box in the voice settings dialog. Also added a raise pitch for capitals check box to configure whether NVDA should actually do its normal pitch raise for capitals. So now you can have either raise pitch, say cap, or beep, for capitals.
* Added the ability to pause speech in NVDA (like found in Voice Over for the Mac). When NVDA is speaking something, you can press the control or shift keys to silence speech just like normal, but if you then tap the shift key again (as long as you havn't pressed any other keys) speech will continue from exactly where it left off.
* Added a virtual synthDriver which outputs text to a window instead of speaking via a speech synthesiser. This should be more pleasant for sighted developers who are not used to speech synthesis but want to know what is spoken by NVDA. There are probably still some bugs, so feedback is most definitely welcome.
* NVDA no longer by default speaks punctuation, you can enable speaking of punctuation with NVDA+p.
* eSpeak by default now speaks quite a bit slower, which should make it easier for people who are using eSpeak for the first time, when installing or starting to use NVDA.
* Added user dictionaries to NVDA. These allow you to make NVDA speak certain text differently. There are three dictionaries: default, voice, and temporary. Entries you add to the default dictionary will happen all the time in NVDA. Voice dictionaries are specific to the current synthesizer and voice you currently have set. And temporary dictionary is  for those times you quickly want to set a rule while you are doing a particular task, but you don't want it to be perminant (it will disappear if you close NVDA). For now the rules are regular expressions, not just normal text.
* Synthesizers can now use any audio output device on your system, by setting the output device combo box in the Synthesizer dialog before selecting the synthesizer you want.

### Performance

* NVDA no longer takes up a huge amount of system memory , when editing messages in mshtml edit controls
* Improved performance when reviewing text inside many controls that do not actually have a real cursor. e.g. MSN Messenger history window, treeview items, listview items etc.
* Improved performance in rich edit documents.
* NVDA should no longer slowly creep up in system memory size for no reason
* Fixed bugs when  trying to focus on a dos console window more than three or so times. NVDA did have a tendency to completely crash.

### Key commands

* NVDA+shift+numpad6 and NVDA+shift+numpad4 allow you to navigate to the next or previous object in flow respectively. This means that you can navigate in an application by only using these two keys with out having to worry about going up by parent, or down to first child as you move around the object hyerarchy. For instance in a web browser such as firefox, you could navigate the document by object, by just using these two keys. If next in flow or previous in flow takes you up and out of an object, or down in to an object, ordered beeps indicate the direction.
* You can now configure voice settings with out opening the voice settings dialog, by using the Synth Settings Ring. The synth settings ring is a group of voice settings you can toggle through by pressing control+NVDA+right and control+NVDA+left. To change a setting use control+NVDA+up and control+NVDA+down.
* Added a command to report the current selection in edit fields (NVDA+shift+upArrow).
* Quite a few NVDA commands that speak text (such as report current line etc) now can spell the text if pressed twice quickly.
* the capslock, numpad insert and extended insert can all be used as the NVDA modifier key. Also if one of these keys is used, pressing the key twice with out pressing any other keys will send the key through to the operating system, just like you'd pressed the key with out NVDA running. To make one of these keys be the NVDA modifier key, check its checkbox in the Keyboard settings dialog (used to be called the keyboard echo dialog).

### Application support

* Improved support for Firefox3 and Thunderbird3 documents. Load times have been improved by almost a factor of thirty, a screen layout is used by default (press nvda+v to toggle between this and no screen layout), a links list (nvda+f7 has been added), the find dialog (control+nvda+f) is now case-insensitive, much better support for dynamic content, selecting and copying text is now possible.
* In the MSN Messenger and Windows Live Messenger history windows, it is now possible to select and copy text.
* Improved support for the audacity application
* Added support for a few edit/text controls in Skype
* Improved support for Miranda instant messenger application
* Fixed some focus issues when opening html and plain text messages in Outlook Express. 
* Outlook express newsgroup message fields are now labeled correctly
* NVDA can now read the addresses in the Outlook Express message fields (to/from/cc etc)
* NVDA should be now more accurate at announcing the next message in out look express when deleting a message from the message list.

### APIs and toolkits

* Improved object navigation for MSAA objects. If a window has a system menu, title bar, or scroll bars, you can now navigate to them.
* Added support for the IAccessible2 accessibility API. A part from the ability to announce more control types, this also allows NVDA to access the cursor in applications such as Firefox 3 and Thunderbird 3, allowing you to navigate, select or edit text.
* Added support for Scintilla edit controls (such controls can be found in Notepad++ or Tortoise SVN).
* Added support for Java applications (via the Java Access Bridge). This can provide basic support for Open Office (if Java is enabled), and any other stand-alone Java application. Note that java applets with in a web browser may not work yet.

### Mouse

* Improved support for reading what is under the mouse pointer as it moves. It is now much faster, and it also now has the ability in some controls such as standard edit fields, Java and IAccessible2 controls, to read the current word, not just the current object. This may be of some used to vision impared people who just want to read a specific bit of text with the mouse.
* Added a new config option, found in the mouse settings dialog. Play audio when mouse moves, when checked, plays a 40 ms beep each time the mouse moves, with its pitch (between 220 and 1760 hz) representing the y axis, and left/right volume, representing the x axis. This enables a blind person to get a rough idea of where the mouse is on the screen as its being moved. This feature also depends on reportObjectUnderMouse also being turned on. So this means that if you quickly need to disable both beeps and announcing of objects, then just press NVDA+m. The beeps are also louder or softer depending on how bright the screen is at that point.

### Object presentation and interaction

* Improved support for most common treeview controls. NVDA now tells you how many items are in the branch when you expand it. It also announces the level when moving in and out of branches. And, it announces the current item number and number of items, according to the current branch, not the entire treeview.
* Improved what is announced when focus changes as you move around applications or the operating system. Now instead of just hearing the control you land on, you hear information about any controls this control is positioned inside of. For instance if you tab and land on a button inside a groupbox, the groupbox will also get announced.
* NVDA now tries to speak the message inside many dialog boxes as they appear. This is accurate most of the time, though there are still many dialogs that arn't as good as they could be.
* Added a report object descriptions checkbox to the object presentation settings dialog. Power users may wish to sometimes uncheck this to stop NVDA announcing a lot of extra descriptions on particular controls,  such as in Java applications.
* NVDA automatically announces selected text in edit controls when focus moves to them. If there isn't any selected text, then it just announces the current line like usual.
* NVDA is a lot more careful now when it plays beeps to indicate progress bar changes in applications. It no longer goes crazy in Eclipse applications such as Lotus Notes/Symphony, and Accessibility Probe.

### User Interface

* Removed the NVDA interface window, and replaced it with a simple NVDA popup menu.
* NVDA's user interface settings dialog is now called General Settings. It also contains an extra setting: a combo box to set the log level, for what messages should go to NVDA's log file. Note that NVDA's log file is now called nvda.log not debug.log.
* Removed the report object group names checkBox from the object presentation settings dialog, reporting of group names now is handled differently.

## 0.5

* NVDA now has a built-in synthesizer called eSpeak, developed by Jonathan Duddington.It is very responsive and lite-weight, and has support for many different languages. Sapi synthesizers can still be used, but eSpeak will be used by default.
 * eSpeak does not depend on any special software to be installed, so it can be used with NVDA on any computer, on a USB thumb drive, or anywhere. 
 * For more info on eSpeak, or to find other versions, go to http://espeak.sourceforge.net/.
* Fix bug where the wrong character was being announced when pressing delete in Internet Explorer / Outlook Express editable panes.
* Added support for more edit fields in Skype.
* VirtualBuffers only get loaded when focus is on the window that needs to be loaded. This fixes some problems when the preview pane is turned on in Outlook Express.
* Added commandline arguments to NVDA:
 * -m, --minimal: do not play startup/exit sounds and do not show the interface on startup if set to do so.
 * -q, --quit: quit any other already running instance of NVDA and then exit
 * -s, --stderr-file fileName: specify where NVDA should place uncaught errors and exceptions
 * -d, --debug-file fileName: specify where NVDA should place debug messages
 * -c, --config-file: specify an alternative configuration file  
 * -h, -help: show a help message listing commandline arguments
* Fixed bug where punctuation symbols would not be translated to the appropriate language, when using a language other than english, and when speak typed characters was turned on.
* Added Slovak language files thanks to Peter Vagner 
* Added a Virtual Buffer settings dialog and a Document Formatting settings dialog, from Peter Vagner.
* Added French translation thanks to Michel Such 
* Added a script to toggle beeping of progress bars on and off (insert+u). Contributed by Peter Vagner.
* Made more messages in NVDA be translatable for other languages. This includes script descriptions when in keyboard help.
* Added a find dialog to the virtualBuffers (internet Explorer and Firefox). Pressing control+f when on a page brings up a dialog in which you can type some text to find. Pressing enter will then search for this text and place the virtualBuffer cursor on this line. Pressing f3 will also search for the next occurance of the text.
* When speak typed characters is turned on, more characters should be now spoken. Technically, now ascii characters from 32 to 255 can now be spoken.
* Renamed some control types for better readability. Editable text is now edit, outline is now tree view and push button is now button.
* When arrowing around list items in a list, or tree view items in a tree view, the control type (list item, tree view item) is no longer spoken, to speed up navigation.
* Has Popup (to indicate that a menu has a submenu) is now spoken as submenu.
* Where some language use control and alt (or altGR) to enter a special character, NVDA now will speak these characters when speak typed characters is on.
* Fixed some problems with reviewing static text controls.
* Added Translation for Traditional Chinese, thanks to Coscell Kao.
* Re-structured an important part of the NVDA code, which should now fix many issues with NVDA's user interface (including settings dialogs).
* Added Sapi4 support to NVDA. Currently there are two sapi4 drivers, one based on code contributed by Serotek Corporation, and one using the ActiveVoice.ActiveVoice com Interface. Both these drivers have issues, see which one works best for you.
* Now when trying to run a new copy of NVDA while an older copy is still running will cause the new copy to just exit. This fixes a major problem where running multiple copies of NVDA makes your system very unusable.
* Renamed the title of the NVDA user interface from NVDA Interface to NVDA. 
* Fixed a bug in Outlook Express where pressing backspace at the start of an editable message would cause an error.
* Added patch from Rui Batista that adds a script to report the current battery status on laptops (insert+shift+b).
* Added a synth driver called Silence. This is a synth driver that does not speak anything, allowing NVDA to stay completely silent at all times. Eventually this could be used along with Braille support, when we have it.
* Added capitalPitchChange setting for synthesizers thanks to J.J. Meddaugh
* Added patch from J.J. Meddaugh that makes the toggle report objects under mouse script more like the other toggle scripts (saying on/off rather than changing the whole statement).
* Added spanish translation (es) contributed by Juan C. buo.
* Added Hungarian language file from Tamas Gczy.
* Added Portuguese language file from Rui Batista.
* Changing the voice in the voice settings dialog now sets the rate, pitch and volume sliders to the new values according to the synthesizer, rather than forcing the synthesizer to be set to the old values. This fixes issues where a synth like eloquence or viavoice seems to speek at a much faster rate than all other synths.
* Fixed a bug where either speech would stop, or NVDA would entirely crash, when in a Dos console window.
* If support for a particular language exists, NVDA now automatically can show its interface and speak its messages in the language Windows is set to. A particular language can still be chosen manualy from the user interface settings dialog as well.
* Added script 'toggleReportDynamicContentChanges' (insert+5). This toggles whether new text, or other dynamic changes should be automatically announced. So far this only works in Dos Console Windows.
* Added script 'toggleCaretMovesReviewCursor' (insert+6). This toggles whether the review cursor should be automatically repositioned when the system caret moves. This is useful in Dos console windows when trying to read information as the screen is updating.
* Added script 'toggleFocusMovesNavigatorObject' (insert+7). This toggles whether the navigator object is repositioned on the object with focus as it changes.
* Added some documentation translated in to various languages. So far there is French, Spannish and Finish.
* Removed some developer documentation from the binary distribution of NVDA, it is only now in the source version.
* Fixed a possible bug in Windows Live Messanger and MSN Messenger where arrowing up and down the contact list would cause errors.
* New messages are now automatically spoken when in a conversation using Windows Live Messenger. (only works for English versions so far)
* The history window in a Windows Live Messenger conversation can now be read by using the arrow keys. (Only works for English versions so far) 
* Added script 'passNextKeyThrough' (insert+f2). Press this key, and then the next key pressed will be passed straight through to Windows. This is useful if you have to press a certain key in an application but NVDA uses that key for something else.
* NVDA no longer freezes up for more than a minute when opening very large documents in MS Word.
* Fixed a bug where moving out of a table in MS Word, and then moving back in, caused the current row/column numbers not to be spoken if moving back in to exactly the same cell.
* When starting NVDA with a synthesizer that doesn't exist, or is not working, the sapi5 synth will try and be loaded in stead, or if sapi5 isn't working, then speech will be set to silence.
* Increasing and decreasing rate scripts can no longer take the rate above 100 or below 0.
* If there is an error with a language when choosing it in the User Interface Settings dialog, a message box will alert the user to the fact.
* NVDA now asks if it should save configuration and restart if the user has just changed the language in the User Interface Settings Dialog. NVDA must be restarted for the language change to fully take effect.
* If a synthesizer can not be loaded, when choosing it from the synthesizer dialog, a message box alerts the user to the fact.
* When loading a synthesizer for the first time, NVDA lets the synthesizer choose the most suitable voice, rate and pitch parameters, rather than forcing it to defaults it thinks are ok. This fixes a problem where Eloquence and Viavoice sapi4 synths start speaking way too fast for the first time.
