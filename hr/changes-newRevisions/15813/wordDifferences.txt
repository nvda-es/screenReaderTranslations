== New Features ==

- New braille tables: +{Afrikaans,}+ Arabic 8 dot computer braille, Arabic grade 2, Spanish grade 2. -{(#4435)}- +{(#4435, #9186)}+
- Added an option to NVDA's mouse settings to make NVDA handle situations where the mouse is controlled by another application. (#8452) 
 - This will allow NVDA to track the mouse when a system is controlled remotely using TeamViewer or other remote control software.

- Added the -{`--disable-start-on-logon`}- +{`--enable-start-on-logon`}+ command line parameter to allow +{configuring whether}+ silent installations of NVDA -{that don't run}- +{set NVDA to start at Windows logon or not. Specify true to start}+ at -{the}- logon -{screen}- +{or false to not start at logon. If the --enable-start-on-logon argument is not specified at all then NVDA will default to starting at logon, unless it was  already configured not to}+ by -{default.}- +{a previous installation.}+ (#8574)
- It is possible to turn NVDA's logging features off by setting logging level to "disabled" from General settings panel. (#8516)
- The presence of formulae in LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice spreadsheets is now reported. (#860)
- In Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, browse mode now reports the selected item in list boxes and trees.
 - This works in Firefox 66 and later.
 - This does not work for certain list boxes (HTML select controls) in Chrome.


- -{Added the Afrikaans braille table. (#9186)
-}- Early support for apps such as Mozilla Firefox on computers with ARM64 (e.g. -{Qualcom}- +{Qualcomm}+ Snapdragon) processors. (#9216)
- A new Advanced Settings category has been added to NVDA's Settings dialog, including an option to try out NVDA's new support for Microsoft Word via the Microsoft UI Automation API. (#9200)
- Added support for the graphical view in Windows Disk Management. (#1486)
- Added support for Handy Tech Connect Braille and Basic Braille 84. (#9249)
-{- Added an experimental option to the Browse Mode Settings panel that allows you to stop  the system focus from following the browse mode cursor. (#2039) Although this may not be suitable to turn off for  all websites, this may fix: 
 - Rubber band effect: NVDA sporadically undoes the last browse mode keystroke by jumping to the previous location.
 - Edit boxes steal system focus when arrowing down through them on some websites.
 - Browse mode keystrokes are slow to respond.}-






== Changes ==
- Updated liblouis braille translator to version 3.8.0. (#9013)


- Add-on authors now can enforce a minimum required NVDA version for their add-ons. -{Unsupported add-ons}- +{NVDA}+ will -{not load}- +{refuse to install}+ or -{install.}- +{load an add-on whose minimum required NVDA version is higher than the current NVDA version.}+ (#6275)
- Add-on authors -{must}- +{can}+ now specify the last version of NVDA the add-on has been tested against. -{Users will be warned}- +{If an add-on has been only tested}+ against -{installing}- +{a  version of NVDA lower than the current version, then NVDA will refuse to install}+ or -{enabling untested add-ons.}- +{load the add-on.}+ (#6275)
- +{This version of NVDA will allow installing and loading of add-ons  that do not yet contain Minimum and Last Tested NVDA version information, but upgrading to future versions of NVDA (E.g. 2019.2) may automatically cause these older add-ons to be disabled.
-}+ The move mouse to navigator object command is now available in Microsoft Word as well as for UIA controls, particularly Microsoft Edge. (#7916, #8371)
- Reporting of text under the mouse has been improved within Microsoft Edge and other UIA applications. (#8370)
- When NVDA is started with the `--portable-path` command line parameter, the provided path is automatically filled in when trying to create a portable copy of NVDA using the NVDA menu. (#8623)
- Updated the path to the Norwegian braille table to reflect the standard from the year 2015. (#9170)

- When navigating by paragraph -{(control+arrows)}- +{(control+up or down arrows)}+ or navigating by table cell (control+alt+arrows), the existence of spelling errors will no longer be announced, even if NVDA is configured to announce these automatically. This is because paragraphs and table cells can be quite large, and -{calculating}- +{detecting}+ spelling errors in some applications can be very costly. (#9217)
- NVDA no longer automatically loads custom appModules, globalPlugins and braille and synth drivers from the NVDA user configuration directory. This code should be instead packaged as an add-on with correct version information, ensuring that incompatible code is not run with current versions of NVDA. (#9238)
 - For developers who need to test code as it is being developed,  enable NVDA's developer scratchpad directory in the Advanced category of NVDA settings, and place your code in the 'scratchpad' directory found in the NVDA user configuration directory when this option is enabled.
