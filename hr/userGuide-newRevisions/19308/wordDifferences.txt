Voices are provided for many languages, and they are more responsive than the Microsoft voices available using Microsoft Speech API version 5.
On Windows 10, NVDA uses Windows OneCore voices by default ([eSpeak NG #eSpeakNG] is used in other releases).


+{To add new Windows OneCore voices, go to "Speech Settings", within Windows system settings. 
Use the "Add voices" option and search for the desired language.
Many languages include multiple variants.
"United Kingdom" and "Australia" are two of the English variants.
"France", "Canada" and "Switzerland" are French variants available.
Search for the broader language (such as English or French), then locate the variant in the list.
Select any languages desired and use the "add" button to add them.
Once added, restart NVDA.}+
