    Attempt to cancel speech for expired focus events (PR #10885)
    
    This experimental feature (disabled by default) can be controlled with a flag in the advanced
    settings panel.
    
    In eventHandler.py keep track of objects that have had focus (on the object, using
    attribute 'wasGainFocusObj').
    This expands on the 'lastQueuedFocusObject' concept.
    
    A cancellable speech command is added to speech sequences that result
    from the focus change event.
    This command is able to check if the object once had focus
    ('wasGainFocusObj') and if it still has focus.
    Speech for objects that no longer have focus can be discarded,
    or cancelled if already with the synth.
    
    Then checking for cancellations is done both early in the speech pipeline (eventHandler) and late
    (speech.manager.speak)
    
    This requires some careful tracking and processing in speech manager.
    When nothing is with the synth, try pushing more.
    Otherwise, there are items in the queue but nothing being spoken.
    When cancelling synth clear tracking of "with synth"
    
    Use _removeCompletedFromQueue rather than _handleIndex
    _handleIndex may not actually call _removeCompleted. Cancelled speech does
    need it's callbacks called.
    
    For now CancellableSpeechCommand should be considered a private API
    
    Updates Changes file for PR #10885
