+++ Tivomatic Caiku Albatross 46/80 ++[Albatross]
+The Caiku Albatross devices, which were manufactured by Tivomatic and available in Finland, can be connected to by either USB or serial.
+You do not need any specific drivers to be installed to use these displays.
+Just plug in the display and configure NVDA to use it.
+
+Note: Baud rate 19200 is strongly recommended.
+If required, switch Baud rate setting value to 19200 from the braille device's menu.
+Although the driver supports 9600 baud rate, it has no way to control what baud rate the display uses.
+Because 19200 is the display default baud rate, the driver tries it at first.
+If baud rates are not the same, the driver may behave unexpectedly.
+
+Following are key assignments for these displays with NVDA.
+Please see the display's documentation for descriptions of where these keys can be found.

 ++ Standard HID Braille displays ++[HIDBraille]
 This is an experimental driver for the new Standard HID Braille Specification, agreed upon in 2018 by Microsoft, Google, Apple and several assistive technology companies including NV Access. 
 The hope is that all future Braille Display models created by any manufacturer, will use this standard protocol which will remove the need for manufacturer-specific Braille drivers.
