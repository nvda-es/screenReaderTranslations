 This includes Microsoft Word itself, and also the Microsoft Outlook message viewer and composer.

+ For the most recent versions of Microsoft Office 2016/365 running on Windows 10 and later, UI Automation support is complete enough to provide access to Microsoft Word documents almost equal to NVDA's existing Microsoft Word support, with the added advantage that responsiveness is majorly increased.
 However, There may be some information which is either not exposed, or exposed incorrectly in some versions of Microsoft Office, which means this UI automation support cannot always be relied upon.
 We still do not recommend that  the majority of users turn this on by default, though we do welcome users of Office 2016/365 to test this feature and provide feedback.
