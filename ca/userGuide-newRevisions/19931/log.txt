    Partial revert of PR #11856 (PR #12695)
    
    Fixes #12653
    
    # Summary:
    PR #11856 introduced speaking symbols when navigating by word.
    The changes produced an unintended side effect of double processing symbols.
    The text replacement for symbols gets spoken at symbol level all.
    
    # Description of fix:
    There isn't enough time before release to be confident in a fix for this behavior, instead the feature is reverted.
    Reverting is in commit 619e5f7
    Some changes have been kept:
    - Symbol level enum: used in other aspects of the code and isn't a cause of this issue
    - System test for notepad: Useful to confirm behavior for reading by word is not changed when this feature is re-introduced.
    
    # Testing strategy:
    Notepad system test
    Generated and checked output of changes doc and userGuide
    Ran NVDA with symbolLevelWordAll = True remaining in config (a problem here would only affect alpha users anyway).
