 For installed copies, NVDA stores the configuration in the roaming application data folder of the current user by default (e.g. "C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming").
 It is possible to change this in a way that NVDA loads its configuration from the local application data folder instead.
 Consult the section about [system wide parameters #SystemWideParameters] for more details.
 
 To start the portable version, go to the directory you unpacked NVDA to, and press enter or double click on nvda.exe.

+- Automatic: Uses UI Automation in consoles on Windows 10 version 1809 and later. This option is recommended and set by default.
+- Prefer UIA: Uses UI Automation in consoles if available, even on Windows versions with incomplete or buggy implementations. While this limited functionality may be useful (and even sufficient for your usage), use of this option is entirely at your own risk and no support for it will be provided.
