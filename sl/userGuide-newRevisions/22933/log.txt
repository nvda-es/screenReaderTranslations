    Correct the syntax of several tables without headers so that they render in HTML correctly: (#16195)
    
    Some reported on translations email list, and some found when double checking.
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Several tables in the user guide are not rendered in HTML correctly, instead showing raw t2t syntax.
    These tables are all tables that do not have table headers, but this is not supported in the intermediate markdown step.
    We need to add a hidden header row.
    There was also a spacing issue in one of the table cells.
    
    Description of user facing changes
    All tables in userGuide.html are correctly rendered in HTML.
    
    Description of development approach
    Correct the syntax of several tables without headers so that they render in HTML correctly:
    
    navigating with NVDA -> Reviewing Text -> numpad review grid table
    Advanced topics -> Commandline options -> short option example table
    Advanced topics -> Commandline options -> example options with arguments table
