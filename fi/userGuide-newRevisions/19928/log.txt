    User guide: mention Windows 11 (#12683)
    
    According to the user guide, latest supported Windows release is Windows 10. As Windows 11 is on the horizon, it makes sense to mention the new operating system in appropriate places throughout the user guide.
    
    Edited the following contents:
    * Supported operating systems (add a note that Windows 11 does not support 32-bit systems but runs 32-bit apps such as NVDA)
    * Windows 10 OCR (mention Windows 11 indirectly)
    * Windows OneCore voices (indirectly mention Windows 11)
    * Other places where Windows 10 is mentioned
    
    * User guide: windows 10 -> Windows 10 (capitalization)
    
    * User guide: remove Windows 11 specific notes in system requirements section.
    
    * Uesr guide: OneCore section -> remove 'new' as OneCore voices are not new anymore
