    Fix QWERTY input - Papenmeier braille displays (PR #11944)
    
    * keyboardHandler.injectRawKeyboardInput:
    Previously, NVDA would send the input manually to its keyboard input hook, and then if the hook didn't handle the input, calling keybd_event. This now avoids assumptions about how NVDA's input hook worked, which are no longer true since #11478 and #11597 were merged.
    
    * Papenmeier braille driver:
    More gesture bindings and fix detection of keyboard input.
