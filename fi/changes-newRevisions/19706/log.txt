    Fix compilation of espeak dictionary for Cantonese and Mandarin (PR #12370)
    
    Compiling the zhy dictionary has failed for a long time, it was excluded because the cause was unknown.
    It was suspected that there was an error in the format of the files.
    Looking into this I found the issue was caused by trying to set the voice to "zhy" by calling espeak_SetVoiceByProperties.
    The result was 2 (ENS_VOICE_NOT_FOUND)
    Compilation was based on using glob to find the *_rules files, and splitting the filename to get the language to use for the voice.
    
    Espeak-ng has renamed zhy and zh files to match the language code that should be used: yue and cmn for Cantonese and Mandarin respectively.
    See espeak-ng/espeak-ng#933
    
    Description of how this pull request fixes the issue:
    This change makes the compilation of espeak dictionaries explicit.
    An explicit listing of the dictionaries NVDA expects (rather than using glob), allows us to be aware of the introduction or removal of languages.
