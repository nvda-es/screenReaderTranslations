    What's new: entry clarifications, fixed empty line problem at the start of bug fixes section for 2018.4. (#8957)
    
    Specifically:
    * Gmail entry: Gmail web interface.
    * Firefox performance entry: changed word order around.
    * Added missing periods.
    * Added an empty line between changes and bug fixes section in order to let txt2tags convert lists correctly.
