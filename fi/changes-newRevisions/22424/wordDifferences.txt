NVDA can now periodically refresh OCR results, speaking new text as it appears.
This can be configured in the Windows OCR category of NVDA's settings dialog.

There's been several braille fixes, improving device detection and caret movement.
It is now possible to opt-out unwanted drivers from automatic detection, to improve autodetection performance.
There are also new BRLTTY commands.
