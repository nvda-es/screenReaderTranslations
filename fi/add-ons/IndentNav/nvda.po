"Indentation Navigation addon.\n"
"It allows NVDA users to navigate by indentation level or offset of lines or "
"paragraphs.\n"
"In browsers it allows to quickly find paragraphs with the same offset from "
"the left edge of the screen, such as first level comments in a hierarchical "
"tree of comments.\n"
"Also while editing source code in many programming languages, it allows to "
"jump between the lines of the same indentation level, as well as quickly "
"find lines with greater or lesser indentation level."
msgstr ""
"Sisennysnavigoinnin lisäosa.\n"
"Sen avulla NVDA:n käyttäjät voivat siirtyä sisennystason, rivipoikkeamien "
"tai kappaleiden mukaan.\n"
"Selaimissa on mahdollista etsiä nopeasti kappaleita, jotka alkavat ruudun "
"vasemmasta reunasta katsottuna samasta kohdasta, kuten esim. ensimmäisen "
"tason kommentit hierarkkisessa kommenttipuussa.\n"
"Lisäksi se mahdollistaa useiden ohjelmointikielien lähdekoodia muokattaessa "
"siirtymisen samalla sisennystasolla olevien rivien välillä sekä sellaisten "
"rivien nopean etsimisen, joilla on suurempi tai pienempi sisennystaso."
