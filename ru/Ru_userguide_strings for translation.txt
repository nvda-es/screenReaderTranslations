The c-series and some other displays have two routing rows whereby the upper row is used to report formatting information.
Holding one of the upper routing keys and pressing the EAB on c-series devices emulates the second switch state.
The live series displays have one routing row only and the EAB has one step per direction.
The second step may be emulated by pressing one of the routing keys and pressing the EAB in the corresponding direction.
Pressing and holding the up, down, right and left keys (or EAB) causes the corresponding action to be repeated.

Generally, the following keys are available on these braille displays:

| Название |Комбинация клавиш|
|---|---|
|l1 |Left front key|
|l2 |Left rear key|
|r1 |Right front key|

### Papenmeier Braille BRAILLEX Older Models {#PapenmeierOld}

The following Braille displays are supported: 

* BRAILLEX EL 80, EL 2D-80, EL 40 P
* BRAILLEX Tiny, 2D Screen

Note that these displays can only be connected via a serial port.
Due to this, these displays do not support NVDA's automatic background braille display detection functionality.
You should select the port to which the display is connected after you have chosen this driver in the [Select Braille Display](#SelectBrailleDisplay) dialog.

Some of these devices have an Easy Access Bar (EAB) that allows intuitive and fast operation.
The EAB can be moved in four directions where generally each direction has two switches.
Pressing and holding the up, down, right and left keys (or EAB) causes the corresponding action to be repeated.
Older devices do not have an EAB; front keys are used instead.

Generally, the following keys are available on braille displays:

### HumanWare BrailleNote {#HumanWareBrailleNote}

NVDA supports the BrailleNote notetakers from [Humanware](https://www.humanware.com) when acting as a display terminal for a screen reader.
The following models are supported:

* BrailleNote Classic (serial connection only)
* BrailleNote PK (Serial and bluetooth connections)
* BrailleNote MPower (Serial and bluetooth connections)
* BrailleNote Apex (USB and Bluetooth connections)

For BrailleNote Touch, please refer to the [Brailliant BI Series / BrailleNote Touch](#HumanWareBrailliant) section.

Except for BrailleNote PK, both braille (BT) and QWERTY (QT) keyboards are supported.
For BrailleNote QT, PC keyboard emulation isn't supported.
You can also enter braille dots using the QT keyboard.
Please check the braille terminal section of the BrailleNote manual guide for details.

If your device supports more than one type of connection, when connecting your BrailleNote to NVDA, you must set the braille terminal port in braille terminal options.
Please check the BrailleNote manual for details.
In NVDA, you may also need to set the port in the [Select Braille Display](#SelectBrailleDisplay) dialog.
If you are connecting via USB or bluetooth, you can set the port to "Automatic", "USB" or "Bluetooth", depending on the available choices.
If connecting using a legacy serial port (or a USB to serial converter) or if none of the previous options appear, you must explicitly choose the communication port to be used from the list of hardware ports.

Before connecting your BrailleNote Apex using its USB client interface, you must install the drivers provided by HumanWare.

On the BrailleNote Apex BT, you can use the scroll wheel located between dots 1 and 4 for various NVDA commands.
The wheel consists of four directional dots, a centre click button, and a wheel that spins clockwise or counterclockwise.

Following are the BrailleNote command assignments for NVDA.
Please check your BrailleNote's documentation to find where these keys are located.
