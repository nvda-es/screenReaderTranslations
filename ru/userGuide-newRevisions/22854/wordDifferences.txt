+{++ Installing MathPlayer ++[InstallingMathPlayer]
Although it is generally recommended to use one of the newer NVDA add-ons to support math in NVDA, in certain limited scenarios MathPlayer may still be a more suitable choice.
E.g. MathPlayer may support a particular language or Braille code that is unsupported in newer add-ons.
MathPlayer is available for free from the Wiris website.
[Download MathPlayer https://downloads.wiris.com/mathplayer/MathPlayerSetup.exe].
After installing MathPlayer, you will need to restart NVDA. 
Please note that information about MathPlayer may state that it is only for older browsers such as Internet Explorer 8.
This is only referring to using MathPlayer to display mathematical content visually, and can be ignored by those using it to read or navigate math with NVDA.}+

+ Braille +[Braille]
If you own a braille display, NVDA can display information in braille.
If your braille display has a Perkins-style keyboard, you can also enter contracted or uncontracted braille.
