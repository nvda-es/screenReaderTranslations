    Convert documentation definition lists to tables (#15950)
    
    Fixes #14240
    
    Summary of the issue:
    Definition lists are not exposed correctly in NVDA.
    They are also not supported in markdown natively.
    In order to convert text2tags to markdown, these must be converted to tables
    
    Description of user facing changes
    Definition lists are now tables in the user guide, which are exposed better by NVDA.
    
    The user guide standards have been updated to encourage the following format for documenting settings.
    The standards have been expanded to further document settings in a well structured manner.
    This is to improve readability, creating a simple standard to learn more about a settings documentation.
    This also allows for the future of automatically collating tables into a settings reference similar to key commands.
    
    Options Default (Enabled), Enabled, Disabled
    Default Enabled
    Toggle command  nvda+shift+e
    Option  Behaviour
    Enabled behaviour of enabled
    Disabled        behaviour of enabled
    Description of development approach
    All t2t files had definition lists converted to markdown.
    The following regex was used to perform the conversion.
    
    To remove the definition list terminator :
    
    Find: ((^:.+\n  .*\n)+):
    replace: $1
    To replace rows:
    
    Find: ^: (.*)\n  (.*)\n
    Replace: || $1 | $2 |\n
