    Remove locale.t2tconf files and references (#15981)
    
    Follow up to #15945
    
    Summary of the issue:
    locale.t2tconf files are no longer required. Setting the language code and direction will happen using custom rules in #15945 when converting markdown to HTML
    
    Description of user facing changes
    None once #15945 is merged
    
    Description of development approach
    locale.t2tconf files were removed.
    References were also removed.
    When saving documents, VS code automatically fixed whitespace issues like mixed line endings.
    The diff should be viewed with "ignore whitespace" on.
