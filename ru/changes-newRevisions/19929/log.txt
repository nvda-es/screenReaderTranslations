    Input Gesture Dialog fix for when there is no filtered Input Gestures (#12693)
    
    Fixes #12673
    
    Summary of the issue:
    The input gestures GUI did not handle the case where there was no filtered input gestures available, such as filtering the gestures for a string like "zzzzzzzzz". This results in multiple input gesture dialogs being able to be opened at once.
    
    Add checks for when the filtered gesture list is empty.
