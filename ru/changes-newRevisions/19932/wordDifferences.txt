- Screen Curtain on previous releases of NVDA is no longer compatible with versions of Windows newer than Windows 10 21H2 (10.0.19044).
This includes Windows 10 Insiders and Windows 11.
This is due to a change in the Windows Magnification API.
When using previous NVDA releases and Windows newer than Windows 10 21H2, screen curtain may fail to work without warning.
To ensure security, confirm that screen curtain works properly with new or experimental versions of Windows.
