+- Suggested conventions have been added to the add-on manifest specification.
+These are optional for NVDA compatibility, but are encouraged or required for submitting to the add-on store.
+The new suggested conventions are:
+  - Using ``lowerCamelCase`` for the name field.
+  - Using ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>`` format for the version field (required for add-on datastore).
+  - Using ``https://`` as the schema for the url field (required for add-on datastore).
+  -
 - Added a new extension point type called ``Chain``, which can be used to iterate over iterables returned by registered handlers. (#14531)
 - Added the ``bdDetect.scanForDevices`` extension point.
 Handlers can be registered that yield ``BrailleDisplayDriver/DeviceMatch`` pairs that don't fit in existing categories, like USB or Bluetooth. (#14531)
