A good way to remember the basic text review commands  when using the Desktop layout  is to think of them as being in a grid of three by three, with top to bottom being line, word and character and left to right being previous, current and next.
The layout is illustrated as follows:
+{|| . {.hideHeaderRow} | . | . |}+
| Previous line | Current line | Next line |
| Previous word | Current word | Next word |
| Previous character | Current character | Next character |

Some of the command line options have a short and a long version, while some of them have only a long version.
For those which have a short version, you can combine them like this:
-{|`` nvda}-

+{|| . {.hideHeaderRow} | . |
| ``nvda}+ -mc CONFIGPATH`` | This will start NVDA with startup sounds and message disabled, and the specified configuration |
| ``nvda -mc CONFIGPATH --disable-addons`` | Same as above, but with add-ons disabled |

Some of the command line options accept additional parameters; e.g. how detailed the logging should be or the path to the user configuration directory.
Those parameters should be placed after the option, separated from the option by a space when using the short version or an equals sign (``=``) when using the long version; e.g.:
+{|| . {.hideHeaderRow} | . |}+
| ``nvda -l 10`` | Tells NVDA to start with log level set to debug |
| ``nvda --log-file=c:\nvda.log`` | Tells NVDA to write its log to ``c:\nvda.log`` |
| ``nvda --log-level=20 -f c:\nvda.log`` | Tells NVDA to start with log level set to info and to write its log to ``c:\nvda.log`` |
